right,"Senate Republicans unveiled their long-awaited version of President Donald Trump’s ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" late Friday night, but its survival is not guaranteed.
The top Democrat in the Senate plans to inflict maximum pain on Senate Republicans in their march to pass President Donald Trump’s ""big, beautiful bill"" before lawmakers even get a chance to debate the legislative behemoth.
Indeed, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he'll force clerks on the Senate floor to read the entirety of the GOP’s 940-page megabill. His move to drain as much time as possible came after Republicans vote on a key procedural test to open debate on the legislation.

""I will object to Republicans moving forward on their Big, Ugly Bill without reading it on the Senate floor,"" Schumer said on X. ""Republicans won’t tell America what’s in the bill
""So Democrats are forcing it to be read start to finish on the floor,"" he said. ""We will be here all night if that’s what it takes to read it.""
KEY GOP SENATOR DEFECTS ON CRUCIAL VOTE, IMPERILING TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' IN NARROW MAJORITY

Indeed, staffers were seen carting the bill onto the Senate floor in preparation for the all-night read-a-thon.
Schumer’s move is expected to take up to 15 hours and is designed to allow Senate Democrats more time to parse through the myriad provisions within the massive legislative text. Ultimately, it will prove a smokescreen as Senate Republicans will continue to march toward a final vote.
Once the bill reading is done, 20 hours of debate evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans will begin, likely early Sunday morning. Democrats are expected to use their entire 10-hour chunk, while Republicans will go far under their allotted time.
Then comes the ""vote-a-rama"" process, where lawmakers can offer an unlimited number of amendments to the bill.

Democrats will again look to extract as much pain as possible during that process, while Republicans, particularly senators that have lingering issues with key Medicaid and land sale provisions, will continue to try and shape and mold the bill.
The last time clerks were forced to read the entirety of a bill during the budget reconciliation process was in 2021, when Senate Democrats held the majority in the upper chamber.
At the time, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., demanded that the entire, over-600-page American Rescue Act be read aloud. Schumer, who was the Senate Majority Leader attempting to ram then-President Joe Biden’s agenda through the upper chamber, objected to the reading."
right,"Check out the best highlights between the St. Louis Cardinals and Cleveland Guardians.
St. Louis Cardinals starting pitcher Sonny Gray turned in one of the most dominant pitching performances of the season in the team’s 5-0 win over the Cleveland Guardians at Progressive Field Friday. 
Gray, 35, completed the ""Maddux,"" pitching nine innings of shutout ball while yielding one hit and striking out 11 batters with just 89 pitches. 
Gray’s performance marks the first time a pitcher tossed a complete-game shutout of under 90 pitches since 2021. New York Yankees ace Max Fried was the last pitcher to do it, when he shut down the Baltimore Orioles as a member of the Atlanta Braves.

The three-time All-Star has thrown seven complete games in his 13-year career, but Friday’s complete game was Gray’s first since 2017, when he did it with the Yankees. 
""I did it a lot earlier in my career, and it’s been a while,"" Gray said after the game. ""You don’t know if you would be able to do it, especially the way the games kind of went, and especially with me. Like, I don’t throw over 100 pitches very often.""

Gray never threw more than 12 pitches in an inning and had two innings with eight or fewer pitches. Gray was on the attack throughout the game with 19 first-pitch strikes to the 28 batters he faced. 
The Cardinals' starter retired 15 of Cleveland’s hitters on three pitches or fewer, including six on the first pitch.

""I knew the innings were kind of moving right along. I did know that I was perfect through that long. I made a good pitch there when the guy got the hit, so I was fine with that,"" Gray said. ""When I was going out for the ninth, it felt like just another inning, which was nice.""
The Cardinals (45-38) will look to build on Gray’s performance when they take on the Guardians (40-40) in the second game of a three-game series Saturday at 4:10 p.m. ET."
right,"The Senate’s version of the One Big Beautiful Bill includes a temporary tax break designed to accelerate investment in American manufacturing and energy infrastructure. A little-noticed provision—Section 70307 of the legislation—would allow businesses to immediately deduct 100 percent of the cost of new “qualified production property” placed in service over the next three years.

The incentive covers a range of assets, including new buildings and facilities used for manufacturing, natural resource extraction, electricity or natural gas production, water systems, and waste disposal. To qualify, the property must be new, used within the United States, and placed in service between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2026.

There is no phase-in or phase-down schedule. The full deduction is available during that window only. Property placed in service after December 31, 2026, would not qualify under the current law.

While previous bonus depreciation rules under Section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code have allowed partial expensing of equipment purchases, the new proposal extends immediate expensing to physical structures—a category of investment traditionally subject to longer depreciation timelines.

The provision appears intended to encourage a wave of near-term industrial construction, potentially pulling forward projects that might otherwise have been delayed. Economists describe such “front-loaded” incentives as capable of creating temporary booms in capital spending, especially when businesses face long permitting and construction lead times.

The depreciation allowance is part of a larger legislative package that also addresses tax credits for families, housing, and clean energy. But unlike many of the bill’s headline items, the expensing provision could quietly shift the economics of factory siting and utility development at the margin.

Policymakers have grown increasingly vocal about the need to rebuild domestic capacity in strategic sectors, particularly in the wake of supply chain disruptions and energy price volatility. The temporary tax break adds to a growing list of federal efforts to onshore industrial investment, joining recent moves such as expanded manufacturing tax credits, permitting reform, and loan guarantees for large-scale infrastructure.

The exact budgetary cost of the provision is not yet known, though analysts note that full expensing primarily shifts the timing of tax deductions rather than creating permanent losses in revenue. Still, the short-term impact on the deficit could be significant if firms accelerate capital projects to take advantage of the expiring benefit.

The bill now heads to the House, where debate over its broader fiscal and policy implications is expected to intensify. But if enacted in its current form, the depreciation provision could mark one of the most substantial tax incentives for U.S. factory construction in years."

A man who took up jogging while recovering from a hernia has shattered a world record by running 465 half-marathons in just one year.
Edward Molineaux, a 34-year-old personal trainer, logged an astonishing 6,000 miles between April 6, 2023, and April 7, 2024. 
His achievement not only broke his own previous record of 282 half-marathons in 12 months, between 2022 and 2023, but also earned him a world title, according to news agency SWNS.
""I used to love sports like boxing, but when I suffered a hernia it took me about two years after my operation to get my body back,"" Molineaux said. 
""All I could do was run. I couldn't turn to anything explosive anymore.""

What began as a way to recover turned into a regular habit. 
Molineaux, who is British, now inspires others through his dedication, according to reports. 
""All I could do was run.""
""I love giving inspiration to other people, and that warrior feeling,"" he said. 
""Even being around people doing well - I like seeing people getting better and going higher.""
The endurance athlete went on to win a 2,000-mile virtual race across Africa.
Molineaux said he structures his week around 13 half-marathon runs, often stacking multiple races in a single day, per SWNS.
""To complete the half-marathons, I split my week into 13 runs, with three on Monday and Wednesday, two on Tuesday and Thursday, and then just one half-marathon for the remaining three days,"" he said.

Even through blisters, trench foot and fatigue, he said he is undeterred.
""Some days I did not feel like doing it, but you need to do it,"" he said. ""It’s one of the hardest parts for me, but I pushed myself.""
His nutrition strategy is as disciplined as his training. 
""I don’t really eat before I run - I don’t like feeling full while I’m getting the miles in,"" he said. ""I stick to a lot of fruit really, mainly bananas. For a half-marathon, I run on an empty stomach, maybe just a banana.""
At night, he said he fuels up on meat and fish. 
""It all comes from belief.""
""You won’t get a stitch, and it won’t stay in the stomach, and you can go at a faster pace,"" he added.
Molineaux’s passion for self-discipline and mental resilience is central to his philosophy.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Saturday confirmed that they had ""eliminated"" one of the founders of Hamas in a joint operation with the Israel Security Agency (ISA). 
Hakham Muhammad Issa Al-Issa, a senior figure in Hamas’ military wing, was killed in Gaza City in an airstrike in the Sabra on Friday, the IDF said. 
Issa’s current role in the Hamas military wing was as head of combat support headquarters, and he led force-buildup efforts in the Gaza Strip, served as head of the training headquarters and was a member of Hamas’ General Security Council.

right,"Jim Harbaugh joins Colin Cowherd to discuss the culture he’s created with the Los Angeles Chargers, Justin Herbert’s mentality and the ‘dog-eat-dog’ chaos of the AFC West. 
Los Angeles Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh was added Friday to a lawsuit against his former employer, the University of Michigan, and a former assistant football coach accused of hacking into computer systems to acquire photos of college athletes.
Attorneys claim Harbaugh allowed Matt Weiss to continue working as co-offensive coordinator in a national playoff game after Weiss was seen viewing private information on a computer in December 2022.
""The university’s delay in taking meaningful protective action until after a high-stakes game sends a clear message: Student welfare was secondary,"" said Parker Stinar, the lead lawyer in a class-action lawsuit arising from a criminal investigation of Weiss.

""Had Harbaugh implemented basic oversight of his staff, plaintiffs and the class would have been protected against predators such as Weiss,"" the updated lawsuit states. ""Instead, Weiss was a highly compensated asset that was promoted by and within the football program, from which position he was able to, and did, target female student athletes.""
Messages from The Associated Press seeking comment from Harbaugh and Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel were not immediately returned Friday.
The lawsuit says a staff member saw Weiss viewing private information at Schembechler Hall, headquarters for the football team, around Dec. 21, 2022, and reported it before Michigan played Texas Christian University in a playoff game days later on Dec. 31.
JIM HARBAUGH DENIES COMMITTING VIOLATIONS AFTER NCAA'S REPORTED NOTICE OF ALLEGATIONS: 'I DO NOT APOLOGIZE'
Weiss was fired a few weeks later in January 2023 during an investigation of his computer use.
Earlier this year, after charges were filed, Harbaugh told reporters he didn’t know anything about Weiss’ troubles until after the playoff game. He said the allegations were ""shocking.""
""Just shocked, completely shocked. Disturbed,"" Harbaugh said in a video shared by the team. ""It was after the TCU game that I found out, we found out, that there was allegations,"" he added. ""And you said it. I mean, indictment, that's not a word that — sympathy for the victims and for Matt's family. It’s shocking.""
The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan announced the indictment this month, more than two years after Weiss, 42, was fired from his coaching position under Harbaugh after an investigation into the alleged crimes.

According to the indictment, Weiss ""gained unauthorized access to student-athlete databases of more than 100 colleges and universities that were maintained by a third-party vendor."" He then allegedly downloaded personal information and data of more than 150,000 athletes. From there, Weiss was able to access the information of more than 2,000 athletes, including access to their social media, email and cloud storage. 
Weiss is accused of using this information to download ""personal, intimate digital photographs and videos that were never intended to be shared beyond intimate partners,"" prosecutors said. The alleged crimes took place from 2015 to January 2023, and he is alleged to have primarily targeted women. 
Weiss, who was fired in 2023 for failing to cooperate with a school investigation, entered a not guilty plea. 
Weiss worked for Harbaugh’s brother, John, on the coaching staff of the NFL’s Baltimore Ravens before joining Michigan in 2021.
The lawsuit says Weiss’ university computer had encryption software that had to be disabled by an external vendor as part of the investigation. Authorities disclosed in April that thousands of intimate photos and videos were found on his electronic devices and cloud storage accounts.

The NCAA previously handed down a four-year show-cause order for Harbaugh after determining the coach had impermissible contact with recruits and players during the COVID-19 restricted period. The organization determined Harbaugh ""engaged in unethical conduct, failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance and violated head coach responsibility obligations.""
Prior to that, Harbaugh and Michigan were under investigation for impermissible in-person scouting and sign-stealing allegations that cast a shadow over Michigan's run to the 2024 national championship. The Big Ten Conference ultimately suspended Harbaugh for three games."
right,"Kentucky businessman and Senate Republican candidate Nate Morris said on Breitbart News Saturday that he is running to end the “reign of Mitch McConnell” and block McConnell’s “puppets” from entering the United States Senate.

Morris announced his bid to replace the outgoing McConnell in a launch video exclusively obtained by Breitbart News Washington Bureau Chief and Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle.

In the launch video, he framed his bid for the Senate as part of a greater populist movement to oust the establishment politicians.

“It’s garbage day in Kentucky — and thanks to Mitch McConnell, things have gotten dirty. The Bluegrass State is sick and tired of cleaning up career politicians’ messes,” Morris, a garbage businessman, said in the ad. “I’m Nate Morris, a Trump, America First conservative — and I’m here to take out the trash.”

“I announced this week to run for the United States Senate to replace Mitch McConnell because I believe Kentucky and the United States, we have had enough of career politicians that have been sabotaging President Trump’s agenda over and over again,” Morris said on Breitbart News Saturday.

Morris referred to his primary opponents, Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) and former state attorney general Daniel Cameron, as McConnell’s “puppets,” noting that they have both referred to McConnell as their “mentor.”

The Kentucky Senate Republican candidate said that McConnell has framed Barr’s and Cameron’s worldviews. He said that once President Donald Trump leaves office, Barr will probably continue to opine about the “virtues of the Bush administration.” As for Cameron, he said the former attorney general squandered a Trump endorsement, failing to beat Gov. Andy Beshear (D) during the last gubernatorial election.

Morris said that he understands the woes of the working-class since he came from a working-class family. Morris is a ninth generation Kentuckian, born to a single mom raised on food stamps, and raised in a union household.

Boyle and Morris spoke about a letter, obtained by Breitbart News, from Robert J. Benvenuti III, inviting Morris to speak at the state Lincoln Dinner on August 9. The letter invites the candidates to speak about their qualifications to become the junior senator from Kentucky; however, it asks that the candidates not speak ill of other Republicans, which Boyle said is designed to protect McConnell from public criticism.

The letter stated:

In the spirit of party unity, I respectfully ask all candidates to honor the great President Reagan’s 11th Commandment — “Though shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican.” The request pertains to Republicans not involved in the U.S. Senate Primary. As Republicans, we fully embrace the vital role vigorous political debate plays in protecting our democracy. At the same time, we ask that you be mindful that this event is designed to further unify Republicans across the Commonwealth and celebrate the greatness of our beloved Nation. I am certain that Kentucky Republicans expect from each of you the professionalism and decorum expected of a Republican United States Senator. Likewise, I trust that each of you agrees that no matter who wins the primary, our collective and ultimate goal must be victory in November of 2026. [Emphasis added]

“It’s absolutely pathetic,” Morris said about the state Republican Party’s effort not to have McConnell criticized during the dinner.

He said, speaking as a businessman, “We need to provide transparency about what’s going on.”

Morris continued, “The fact that our own state party is running cover for Mitch and trying to protect him, and by the way, the other thing that’s not mentioned, that I found out — they’re giving Mitch McConnell the Lifetime Achievement Award at this dinner.”

He remarked, “Mitch McConnell has done everything he can to sabotage President Trump’s agenda,” referring to McConnell as the “ultimate thorn” in Trump’s side.

Morris will host Charlie Kirk in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, on Monday, June 30. Morris said, “It’s going to be one for the ages.”

right,"Constitutional Accountability Center President Elizabeth Wydra and constitutional attorney Mark Smith weigh in on how the Supreme Court limiting nationwide injunctions on federal judges will impact the birthright citizenship ruling.
In Trump v. Casa, the United States Supreme Court finally put an end to the universal injunctions that trial judges had invented to block presidents from pushing their agendas nationwide.
These orders, which courts applied with special vigor against President Donald Trump, ""exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to federal courts,"" the 6-3 majority declared. Even though Casa resolved a question of technical legal procedure, it struck a balance between the Executive and Judicial branches of government that bore greater constitutional importance.
SCOTUS RULES ON TRUMP'S BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP ORDER, TESTING LOWER COURT POWERS
Casa represented an undeniable victory for the Trump administration. In ruling against many of Trump’s executive orders, district courts had used nationwide injunctions to halt such major initiatives as Trump’s suspension of foreign aid, removal of illegal aliens from Venezuela, layoffs of federal bureaucrats, a bar on transgender soldiers, ending racially discriminatory programs in higher education, and cuts and freezes in federal spending. Trump is now free to enforce those policies in states where the courts have not enjoined them. Ultimately, the Supreme Court will have to resolve the conflict between the federal courts that have enjoined Trump’s policies and those in other states that have not.

But the legal, rather than the political, issue asks more narrowly how far a federal trial judge – of which there are almost 700 – may go in stopping government action he or she concludes violates the law. All agree that the trial court can grant relief to the parties in the courtroom. In Casa itself, federal judges in several cities ruled unconstitutional Trump’s executive order denying citizenship to children born on American territory whose parents were in the U.S. illegally. But rather than simply order the recognition of the citizenship of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits, the courts forbade the Trump administration from pursuing the new policy throughout the entire nation.
These lower court judges claimed a sweeping power that had never existed before in American history. Nationwide injunctions were virtually unknown until the 21st Century. As Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s majority opinion made clear, the Framers would not have understood the Constitution’s grant of power to the federal courts to resolve ""cases or controversies"" under federal law to include nationwide injunctions.
As late as President Barack Obama’s administration, it appears the lower courts had only issued about 19 such injunctions. In 2019, Attorney General William Barr stated that the federal courts had issued only 27 in the twentieth century. But by April 2024, 127 nationwide injunctions had been issued since 1963, with 96 packed into 2001 to 2023. There were six nationwide injunctions under the second Bush administration, 12 under Obama, a staggering 64 under the first Trump administration, and 14 from the first three years of Biden. As of the end of March, just 10 weeks into Trump’s second term, federal judges had issued 17 such injunctions.
The very fact that nationwide injunctions were little known to the lower federal courts until the present century undercuts the notion that they were understood by the Framers to fall with the ""judicial power"" of Article III of the Constitution. Nationwide injunctions violated not just the text, but also the structure of the Constitution. As the majority in Casa concluded, district judges were claiming a supremacy that ignored the equal role of the other branches of government in interpreting the Constitution. They threatened to transform the power of the federal courts to decide ""cases or controversies"" into a supervisory power to manage the workings of the government nationwide.
In its deepest constitutional failure, the use of nationwide injunctions prevented the president from advancing his own reading of the Constitution. The Constitution does not establish any branch of the federal government as supreme in its interpretation. Instead, each of the branches must give meaning to our nation’s highest law when they carry out their unique constitutional responsibilities. Judicial review, for example, emerges from the court’s sole authority to decide ""cases or controversies"" arising under federal law. Congress interprets the Constitution when it decides whether to enact bills into law. Presidents give meaning to the Constitution when they veto legislation or ""take care that the laws are faithfully executed.""
In the very first year of the Constitution, for example, President George Washington decided that the national bank was constitutional when he signed the legislation creating it. He interpreted the Constitution to vest the power over foreign policy in the executive branch when he decided to issue the Neutrality Proclamation. Later, President Andrew Jackson vetoed a re-authorization of the very same bank, even though Congress believed the law constitutional by passing it, two past presidents had signed earlier versions of the law, and the Supreme Court had upheld the law in McCullough v. Maryland. Jackson correctly argued that the Supreme Court could not force him to sign the law. He declared that ""The Congress, the Executive, and the Court must each for itself be guided by its own opinion of the Constitution."" 
In fulfilling its constitutional functions, Jackson believed, each branch has an equal and independent duty to decide upon the constitutionality of legislation.
""The opinion of the judges has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over the judges,"" Jackson declared. And, he emphasized, ""on that point the President is independent of both.""   
Abraham Lincoln went furthest in claiming that presidents had the right to pursue their own interpretation of the Constitution at odds with the view of the Judiciary. In his famous debates with Stephen Douglas, Lincoln argued that the Dred Scott decision applied only to the parties in the case. The president had to obey the decision of the Court – which party won or lost the case. But the Court’s logic and reasoning could not bind the president or Congress, which both had the right to interpret the Constitution too, or, ultimately, the people. 
""I do not deny that such decisions may be binding in any case, upon the parties to a suit, as to the object of that suit,"" Lincoln said in his first inaugural address. Decisions of the Court should receive ""very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of government,"" he continued.
But ""if the policy of the government, upon vital questions, affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court,"" Lincoln argued, ""the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.""
Casa honors Lincoln’s understanding of the balance of power between the president and the Court. Under Lincoln’s view, the president has the right to advance his reading of the Constitution even if a court has enjoined it elsewhere. While Lincoln conceded that he would obey judicial decisions, he argued that he could continue to enforce his policies against individuals outside the parties in Dred Scott. And Lincoln believed he had no constitutional obligation to apply Dred Scott to new cases. Judges would have to issue orders in each future case ordering him to return free blacks to slavery under Dred Scott. Casa rejects the notion that a single district court could force a president to obey its reading of the Constitution throughout the nation, even in cases not yet brought.
A president may accept the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Constitution, but in order to reach the Court, the president will test his reading of the Constitution in other courts. Armed with a nationwide injunction, a single judge who first decides an important constitutional issue effectively short-circuits the ability of other courts to examine the issue. But a president should have the right to go to the federal courts in other states; should the courts disagree, the Supreme Court can resolve the conflict. Nationwide injunctions prevented presidents from advancing their reading of the Constitution in other courts and ultimately bringing their policies to the Supreme Court quickly.
Trump now has the opportunity to test the constitutionality of birthright citizenship (where I happen to think he is wrong) before the Justices, as is his right."
right,"Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., provides the latest details on President Donald Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ during an appearance on ‘ Live.’ 
A key New York Republican said he's pleased with a tax provision in the Senate's version of President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" after weeks of tense back-and-forth over the matter.
""I think it's a very good deal. We were able to keep the House language intact,"" Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., told  Digital, adding that he was pleased ""we were able to solve"" differences on tax deductions for certain pass-through businesses, which are companies smaller than corporations whose taxes are ""passed through"" the business owner's personal returns.
""I think at the end of the day, it's a [four-times] increase on [state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps]. And despite the Senate's best efforts to whittle down the language, we were able to keep it.""
Lawler is one of several blue state Republicans who threatened to sink the bill if it did not sufficiently raise SALT deduction caps.
HOUSE CONSERVATIVES GO TO WAR WITH SENATE OVER TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'
Rep. Mike Lawler spoke with  Digital about the Senate's SALT compromise. (Tierney L. Cross)
SALT deductions are aimed at providing relief for people living in high-cost-of-living areas, primarily in big cities and their suburbs. 
There was no limit on SALT deductions until Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which capped that federal tax benefit at $10,000 for both single filers and married couples.
The House's bill raised that cap to $40,000 for 10 years, with households making up to $500,000 eligible for the full deduction.
Senate Republicans, who released their text of the bill just before midnight on Friday night, reduced the benefit window to five years instead of 10. 
After that, the maximum deduction would revert to $10,000 for the next five years.
""Yes, the time was shortened, but at the end of the day, people are going to immediately be able to deduct them to $40,000, which is a massive win,"" Lawler told  Digital.
""Democrats promised to fix this when they had complete control in '21 and '22 and failed to deliver. We're delivering on it. So you know to me this is a big win for New York. It's a big win for taxpayers all across the country.""
Blue state Republicans, primarily those in New York and California, have pushed hard in favor of lifting that cap. They've painted it as an existential political issue in their districts, where Republican victories were critical to the GOP winning and keeping its House majority.

They've also argued that their states sending more money back to the federal government effectively subsidizes lower-tax states that do not bring in as much revenue.
But Republicans in more GOP-leaning states have dismissed SALT deductions as a reward for high-tax Democratic states to continue their own policies.
""SALT deductions allow blue states to export their political mistakes (electing high-tax, crazy socialists), Americans shouldn’t subsidize,"" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, wrote on X.
Lawler would not say if his support for the deal meant he would vote for the final bill – noting there were other provisions he had to read through in the 940-page legislation.

But he said he believed most of his Republican colleagues in the SALT Caucus would be supportive of the compromise.
""I think there's broad consensus among most of us about how important this is, and what a significant win it is,"" Lawler said.
Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., the only member of the SALT Caucus who sits on the tax-writing House Ways & Means Committee, told  Digital of the deal on Friday, ""I can live with this but, quite frankly, the $30,000 over 10 years that I negotiated out of Ways & Means would’ve protected my constituents for a longer period of time.""
""But alas, this is a group exercise and there are a lot of cooks in the kitchen,"" she said.
Not everyone is on board, however. Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., signaled to  Digital that he is rejecting the deal.

""While I support the president’s broader agenda, it would be hypocritical for me to back the same unfair $10k SALT cap I’ve spent years criticizing. A permanent $40k deduction cap with income thresholds of $225k for single filers and $450k for joint filers would earn my vote,"" he said in a written statement.
Rep. Young Kim, R-Calif., did not comment on the SALT deal itself but more broadly said her support for the bill is contingent on how decisions on SALT deduction caps, Medicaid measures, and small business taxes play out."
right,"Rep. Addison McDowell (R-NC) told Breitbart News Saturday the Senate is nearing final passage of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, setting the stage for a July 4 signing ceremony that would mark a landmark legislative victory and historic economic boost.

“This is the President Trump agenda, and it is exactly how we course correct from the Biden era,” McDowell said. “I’m looking forward to the Senate getting this done and getting it back to us so we can pass it as soon as possible. That July 4 signing ceremony would be something very special.”

McDowell pointed out there has been back-and-forth between the House and Senate, noting that Trump and the White House have been involved, “and that’s how it should be.”

“We’re going to secure our country, whether the Democrats want us to or not,” McDowell added. “It’s exactly what we’re doing with this bill. This is the President’s promise for the American people, and we’re making good on that.”

The Congressman also took aim at Democrats for uniformly opposing the bill despite its provisions to make permanent the 2017 Trump tax cuts, eliminate taxes on tips and overtime, fund border security, and unleash domestic energy production.

“I just don’t understand why they would want the largest tax increase in the history of our country to impact everyday Americans. It is unbelievable.” McDowell stated. “This is a pro-job, pro-job-creator, pro-worker, pro-family, pro-clean-energy, pro-energy bill, and they’re against it for God knows why.”

McDowell also highlighted the HALT Fentanyl Act, which passed both chambers and awaits President Trump’s signature. The bill holds personal significance for the Congressman, who lost his younger brother to fentanyl poisoning.

“Through this legislation, we’re giving law enforcement the tools to fight back against the cartels,” he explained. “We’re preventing knockoff fentanyl, which is more deadly, from becoming street legal, and penalizing and hopefully deterring people from peddling it into our communities by increasing mandatory minimums. The President is going to sign this into law, and it’s a great step in the right direction of getting this poison off our streets.”

As Trump racks up foreign and domestic policy successes from brokering ceasefires and trade deals to pushing NATO allies toward higher defense spending and securing a peace agreement between Rwanda and Congo, McDowell described the momentum as “undeniable.”

“The Democrats are furious. They are in complete disarray, which is why you see them electing a communist as their nominee to be the mayor of New York City,” McDowell asserted. “They have no leader. They have no idea what they’re doing, and they’re furious that the President keeps getting win after win after win.”

“Donald Trump has the potential to be the most consequential president since George Washington,” he concluded. “He’s keeping all of his promises. We finally have a President who stands up for America and wins day after day after day.”"

A vulnerable Senate Republican put his foot down against President Donald Trump’s ""big, beautiful bill"" over concerns of deep Medicaid cuts inside the megabill.
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told  Digital that he would not support the measure through a procedural hurdle necessary to kick off a marathon of debate and amendment voting that would eventually culminate in the measure’s final passage.

Tillis, who is up for reelection in 2026, said after exiting the Senate GOP’s closed-door lunch that he has a ""great relationship"" with his colleagues, but that he couldn’t support the colossal bill.
""We just have a disagreement,"" he said. ""And, you know, my colleagues have done the analysis, and they're comfortable with the impact on their states. I respect their choice. It's not a good impact in my state, so I'm not going to vote on the motion to proceed.""

He also won’t support the bill during the final stretch. Tillis is part of a cohort of Senate Republicans who have expressed reservations over the Senate GOP’s changes to the Medicaid provider tax rate.
Tillis’ resistance to the bill is a bad sign for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who can only afford to lose three votes. So far, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., has vowed to vote against the procedural test, and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is expected to follow suit. 
Trump was meeting with Johnson and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fl., another possible holdout, during the lunch. 
Lawmakers are expected to vote to advance the bill at 4 p.m. on Saturday. 
The mounting resistance could force Thune to go back to the drawing board. Further complicating matters is Collins, who is also up for reelection in 2026, who said that while she would support the bill through the first step, she was leaning against voting to pass the bill in the final stretch unless the legislation was ""further changed.""
SENATE GOP EYES MEDICAID SWEETENER TO SAVE TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

The latest version of the bill, which dropped near the stroke of midnight, included tweaks to the Senate’s offering that would push back the provider rate crackdown by one year, and also added another $25 billion for a rural hospital stabilization fund.
While others in the group, like Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., are on board to at least see the legislation move through the first key procedural hurdle, Tillis has argued that his state would be harshly affected by the crackdown.
Indeed, during a closed-door lunch earlier this week, the lawmaker reportedly warned that North Carolina could lose as much as $40 billion in Medicaid funding if the changes were codified.
For now, Tillis is unlikely to budge, even after conversations with Trump. He is also planning to unveil further analysis on the impact of Medicaid cuts on his state that he said no one in the ""administration or in this building"" has been able to refute.
""The president I have talked, and I just told him that, ‘Look, if this works for the country, that's great. And if my other colleagues have done extensive research and concluded it's different in their states, I respect that,’"" he said. ""We just have a disagreement based on the implementation in our respective states."""

right,"Sen, Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) made the final pitch for the budget reconciliation bill during an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday, noting that it not only prevents a massive tax increase on the American people but enhances border security, ushers in energy independence, and much more.

Mullin predicted there could be a final passage in the Senate by early Monday. But he took time to explain why the bill is important and what it will do for the American people as Congress eyes President Donald Trump’s preferred July 4 deadline.

“Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to prevent a 4 trillion — that’s with a ‘T’ — a $4 trillion tax increase on American people. That doesn’t matter what class you’re in. You can be lower class, middle class, or the top one percent. Every class, if this bill doesn’t pass, will see a $4 trillion tax increase,” he explained, asking if U.S. taxpayers really need to send $4 trillion more to D.C.

“The answer that is, heck no! Keep that in your own community. Invest that in your own community. And when you when you as a business owner, you get to invest in your company, which invests in your community, invest in your state. You can spend that a lot better in Washington, DC,” he said.

The bill, he continued, also “finishes building the wall.”

“It doesn’t allow another administration to come in and say, you know, ‘We’re not going to build the wall. In fact, we’re going to sell the material for literally a penny on the dollar and get rid of it.’ No, this actually completes the entire southern wall, which brings in border security,” Mullin said, explaining that it also invests in the security force, allowing for more border and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to be brought into the fold.

“We’re investing in new border agents and ICE agents to help clean our streets up of these illegal immigrants or illegal aliens. They’re not immigrants. Of course, the left media will call it, ‘We’re going after immigrants.’ We’re not going after immigrants,” he said, noting that Democrats are “hijacking” immigrants and lumping them in with illegal aliens.

Further, the bill, Mullin said, ushers in energy independence.

“True energy independence, where we’re not going to be relying on Middle East oil. We’re not going to be relying on what happens in Europe to control our energy costs. We’re going to be energy independent. What that means is, no matter what’s going on around the world, our energy can be stable, and then we can become a net exporter of energy, like we should be, because we have more energy reserves in our country than any other country in the world,” the senator said.

Additionally, the bill “stabilizes our economy” and “cuts waste and fraud,” according to Mullin. “It holds the government accountable.”

Mullin also explained why the bill does not address more cuts, explaining, “Because this is called reconciliation.”

“DOGE cuts deals with discretionary spending. Discretionary spending are the appropriation bills that we do every year, which typically leads to a CR, continued resolution. This because of its reconciliation, it can only deal with mandatory spending, which is Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security — but Social Security we can’t touch because of the Byrd Rule — and it deals with taxes,” he explained further.

“So there’s several pieces of the pie that we’re going after,” Mullin said, describing the bill as “one of a three step process of giving our fiscal house in order.”

“But we’re cutting $1.6 trillion roughly. I’m using a rough number, because that number could change up or down depending on what the final package is. But regardless of what it is, we will have the largest deficit reduction in spending than any Congress in history,” he added.

“If that’s not moving our country in the right direction, please tell me what is.”

EXCLUSIVE — The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) is facing a new threat as Hamas terrorists allegedly place bounties on the heads of its workers, including U.S. security personnel and local aid staff. 
According to GHF, Hamas is offering monetary rewards to anyone who kills or injures the organization’s workers.
""We are aware of credible reports that Hamas is openly targeting the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and those who work with us. According to these reports, Hamas has placed bounties on both our American security personnel and Palestinian aid workers, offering cash rewards to anyone who injures or kills them,"" GHF said in a statement provided exclusively to  Digital.
""The targets of Hamas’ brutality are heroes who are simply trying to feed the people of Gaza in the middle of a war.""

right,"Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) records show thousands of Iranian nationals may be eligible to be arrested nationwide on immigration-related issues. These are in addition to the approximately 1,500 Iranian nationals whom the Border Patrol detained after entering the country illegally during President Joe Biden’s term. ICE Data shows nearly 6,000 Iranians who may have entered legally but have since violated their legal status may soon be the focus of the ongoing ICE dragnet.

The number of Iranians arrested by ICE since the U.S. military action on Iran’s nuclear sites may soon pale in comparison to the arrest of those who may have entered the United States legally but are currently at some stage in the removal process. According to a recent social media post by reporter Ali Bradley, there are nearly 6,000 Iranian nationals who are inside the United States and are identified as removable or will soon become removable, who ICE is not currently detaining.

According to Bradley, the data she exclusively obtained from DHS sources shows nearly 1,300 of the almost 6,000 Iranian nationals on the ICE non-detained docket have criminal convictions. The information reveals that 2,970 Iranian nationals have final orders of removal, and approximately half of the overall number are in the removal process, pending final orders of removal.

The non-detained docket maintained by U.S. Immigration and Customs officials can include foreign nationals who entered the United States legally but later violated conditions of entry, resulting in the aliens being placed into removal proceedings. When an alien is placed on ICE’s non-detained docket, it does not necessarily mean the alien is not detained; it merely signifies the alien is not detained in an ICE facility.

The docket can include aliens convicted of criminal offenses that make them removable from the country who are being detained in federal or state prisons as they serve any remaining time on their criminal sentences. In such cases, immigration detainers are placed with the facilities, with the hope that ICE will be notified upon the alien’s release.

In other cases, some aliens are placed into ICE Alternatives to Detention (ATD) programs, which allow them to remain free while the removal process progresses through the immigration courts—a process that can take years. ATD programs can involve simple check-in monitoring by reporting to ICE offices regularly, the use of ankle monitoring devices, or through government-issued smartphones that allow for the tracking of an alien’s whereabouts.

One recent arrest in New Orleans, Louisiana, shows ICE officials are likely intensifying their arrests of Iranians listed on the non-detained docket. On Sunday, a family in the Lakeview neighborhood reported the arrest of 64-year-old Mandonna Kashanian, who entered the United States nearly 50 years ago.

According to a local news report, the family alleges Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested Kashanian in front of the family home. According to the family, Kashanian entered the United States legally on a student visa in the 1970’s but failed to leave once the visa expired. Kashanian, according to her family, was granted a stay of removal several years ago. That may prevent her removal to Iran, but will not likely prevent her removal to a third country according to existing immigration law as highlighted in a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

As reported by Breitbart Texas, during the four fiscal years of the Biden administration, Border Patrol agents intercepted approximately 1,500 Iranian nationals who entered the United States illegally at the southern border. Of those apprehended by Border Patrol agents, officials say nearly half were released into the U.S. interior.

As of June 26, more than 100 Iranian nationals illegally in the United States were arrested by ICE officer nationwide. According to recent  report, 670 Iranian nationals are in currently being held in ICE detention facilities as the agency ramps up its efforts arrest Iranian nationals in the country illegally.

“We’re still in negotiations, but right now we’re just kind of putting the pieces together. I mean, we negotiated as much as we can. We’re putting the final pieces together,” he said, noting that senators have had dozens of meetings about the measure.

“There’s a lot of passion about it. A lot of people don’t love the bill, and we’ve said that all along. You’re not going to get a perfect bill, because even in the Senate, you take — a Republican senator from Utah is quite different than a Republican senator from Florida. And then you put Oklahoma and everybody — all the other red states in the middle, there’s some big differences here, and that’s why we negotiate,” he said.

Mullin explained that members have been told that if they have an idea, it is their responsibility to get the votes for it. Otherwise, it is merely an idea.

“And if you can’t get 51 votes, then we’ve got to move on to an idea that can get the votes, because regardless, this bill can’t fail. And so we’ve got to put a bill on the floor that can get 51 votes, that can go over to the House and get the required number,” he said, emphasizing that it must pass the House.

“It’s got to get to the President’s desk, because we got to deliver for the American people. They put us in office in November for us to control government and get away from the Biden administration’s policies. And so when we when this bill does come to the floor, which I think we’ll be voting on — when we say getting on the bill, that means that we start the 20 hour debate clock, and then we’ll do a vote-a-rama, and then the final passage,” Mullin said, expecting a final passage by early Monday.

“We could possibly get to it late Sunday, but more likely at this rate, is probably going to be early Monday. Anyway, when that final passage bill comes up, no matter where your position is on the bill prior to this, no matter how hard you fought for your idea, when a bill finally is put to the floor, complete and for passage, you have two choices,” he made clear, explaining that Republicans must unite.

“There is no C. Either choose to vote for a bill that’s moving us towards the Trump policy and into the Trump presidency era, moving us away from the Biden era and the disastrous policies,” the senator stressed.

“A ‘no’ vote says I’d rather stay with Biden’s policies. A ‘yes’ vote says we’re moving forward and putting that woke DEI, socialist, apologetic appeasement policies of the Biden administration behind us and moving forward to a new strong economy and peace through strength,” Mullin added.

right,"America continues to tally up win after win with President Donald Trump at the helm, Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) said during an interview on Breitbart News Saturday.

When asked how the forthcoming passage of the “big, beautiful bill” fits into the greater picture of what is going on in America under Trump’s leadership, Mullin asked, “Is anybody in this country tired of winning?”

“Because that’s what this is, what winning looks like when you have a president that knows how to lead. He knows the economy; he knows what needs to be done. He knows what peace through strength is, and he knows how to use it,” Mullin began.

“He knows how to use deterrence. He knows how to get the respect of leaders around the world,” the senator said, noting that this is a restoration of what was lost over the previous four years under the leadership — or lack thereof — of former President Joe Biden.

“The world was needing someone to lead peace through strength. If the United States isn’t out there, who is going to be out there? When the United States isn’t leading from the front, it creates a vacuum where everybody else tries to lead, and they lead from a different perspective,” he said. “We lead from a perspective of peace. They lead from a perspective of conquering.”

“We, with the United States, we’re not trying to conquer anybody. We’re not trying to take over your country. What we’re trying to do is stabilize and bring peace throughout the region. That’s what President Trump has talked about,” he said, touting Trump’s successful strikes against Iran’s nuclear sites.

“And even with a successful, complete success, of taking out … the nuclear ability of Iran, even though the Democrats can’t accept success — which kind of blows my mind — even with that, you had the Democrats having a hard time understanding that this was a successful day,” Mullin lamented.

“We eliminated a rogue regime that was a number one sponsor of terror around the world from getting a nuclear weapon,” he said, adding that every president since Bill Clinton has talked about that.

“Trump was the first one that had the backbone to actually do it and not just do it, but annihilate it and end a 12-day war. And guess what? Immediately have a cease fire and peace talks with Israel and Iran. Did anybody think that would ever take place?” he asked, telling listeners that he has had ambassadors from all over the Middle East come to him and praise the fact that Trump was able to take out the nuclear capabilities of Iran.

“No one in that region wanted that — wanted Iran to have a nuclear weapon,” he said, pointing out that despite the success, leftists still cannot give Trump credit for what he was able to accomplish.

“He’s restoring peace and at the same time negotiating one big, beautiful bill, at the same time going around and meeting with world leaders and negotiating trade deals and getting tariffs under control. At the same time meeting with businesses and influencing them to invest inside the United States,” Mullin continued.

LISTEN:

The senator also said he spoke to Trump Friday night, and the president guessed that it was his thousandth phone call of the day.

“I don’t know when the guy sleeps. And he says, I think you’re my one-thousandth call today. He said, I’ve had 1,000 –literally 1,000 — calls today. And he looked at his phone, he’s like, ‘No, my team just sent me a note. I’ve had 246 calls just this afternoon,’ he said, ‘So maybe I’m over 1,000.’ He was laughing about it. But that’s how busy [he] is,” Mullin said, admiring Trump’s ability to do that and lead the country and “continue to win.”

“I mean, it’s remarkable — remarkable,” Mullin said. “He impresses me every day I’m around.”

He has not been criminally charged. 
The woman, identified as Jane Doe A.G., claimed to have met the college football player on social media before agreeing to visit him at his apartment to play video games, ESPN reported. 
According to the complaint, the woman alleged she and Retzlaff began kissing, but he ignored her requests to stop and continued ""escalating the situation."" 
The original complaint alleged that after the alleged victim attempted to leave, Retzlaff put his hands around her neck and raped her, ESPN reported. 
In new filings Friday, Retzlaff denied the allegations and claimed the two had engaged in consensual sex.

""And no, I’m not saying f--- actual Palestine. But f--- your dumb a-- slogans and performative b-------. Yall wanna make a stance so bad but stand for absolutely nothing.""
She then accused people in the media of having outrage over something they know nothing about, adding, ""And all of a sudden yall are throwing around words like genocide and Zionist not even knowing the meaning of those words while you drive around in ur teslas and leave comments from your iPhones all built off the backs and the blood of children working in mines from dusk til dawn.""

In a statement, Boomtown Festival disputed Banks’ claims that promoters tried to get her to say anything, though it confirmed she had been dropped.

right,"The open-borders Cato Institute is on the defensive after one of its top pro-migration advocates dismissed the overdose deaths of many young Americans as “voluntary” transactions.

The statement came a day after Rep. Tom Tiffany (R-WI) grilled Alex Nowrasteh — Cato’s vice president for economic and social policy studies — about his support for President Joe Biden’s mass migration.

Tiffany asked Nowrasteh during the Wednesday hearing if his calculations about migrant crimes included drug deaths.

Nowrasteh dismissed drug overdoses as commercial accidents: “Do you mean the people who voluntarily took fentanyl and overdosed under that tragic situation? No, those are not homicides, sir.”

That statement came shortly after Nowrasteh had said: “Every death and every murder is a tragedy, and those individual criminals should be punished to the fullest extent of the law, but that is not a reason to punish other people [migrants] who are not criminals.”

Nowrasteh’s dismissal echoes his prior support for the decriminalization of drugs and easy migration across U.S. borders, saying, “People want drugs, others want to sell them, and the government gets in the way.”

Nowrasteh’s dismissal of ordinary Americans and discarded Americans helps to explain recent political revolutions, including the 2016 and 2024 elections of Donald Trump and the June 2025 mayoral nomination of Indian immigrant Zohran Mamdani in New York.

Cato was originally named the Charles Koch Foundation and is governed and funded by wealthy business leaders. In 2024, the organization received almost $63 million from donors as part of its $79 million yearly revenue.

On Thursday, Cato did damage control with a tweet saying, “You may have seen @AlexNowrasteh’s testimony on Capitol Hill yesterday. He’s here to clarify some information.”

But Nowrasteh offered a brief misdirection as he evaded the central issue of his long-standing political support for the easy transfer of drugs across national barriers to U.S. drug addicts. He said:

Yesterday, I testified in front of the House Judiciary Committee, and boy, was it a heated and emotional exchange. First off, I just want to repeat that I support prosecuting illegal immigrant criminals to the fullest extent of the law. Secondly, there is a big problem with fentanyl overdoses in the United States, and that needs to be addressed in a serious and thoughtful manner. But lastly, we need facts in this debate about immigration, Illegal immigrants and klegal immigrants have a substantially lower crime rate than native born Americans, and we just can’t have a productive debate and discussion about public policy without those facts.

One of the facts in the immigration debate is that the federal government’s long-standing policy of quiet tolerance for illegal immigration helped criminals establish cross-border drug-smuggling networks that have killed hundreds of thousands of Americans.

The massive inflow also shifted wealth from young couples, leading to a drop in birth rates.

The resulting massive population loss has spurred pro-migration advocates to argue that the government must import yet more migrants to help expand business activity.

But Trump was elected to shut down the huge inflow of illegal migration.

Now that the cross-border inflow of illegal migrants has stopped, drug deaths are dropping as many addicts are being rescued by emergency treatments.

After host John King played a montage of Republicans criticizing President Barack Obama for his use of executive power, Honig said that the ruling “means that the president is far more powerful than the president was 24 hours ago. When I say the president, I mean Donald Trump. But I mean the presidency, the office as an institution.”

He continued, “And it’s really important to note, John, consistent with what you just showed us, that who opposes which of these depends on which party’s in the White House. I want to read you something that was written by the Biden administration in December of 2024, they submitted a brief to the Supreme Court arguing the exact same thing the Trump administration has argued here. The Biden administration wrote, ‘The district court [entered] a “nationwide injunction,”…such universal remedies exceed “the power of [Article III] courts,”‘ and ‘conflict with “longstanding limits on equitable relief,”‘ so, this should not be seen as some mad power grab by Donald Trump.

Liccardo responded, “Folks can position all they want. … Look, I’m not really privy to a lot of insights about how this Governor’s going to run.”

right,"On Friday’s “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks said that he agrees with the Supreme Court decision on nationwide injunctions and “Democrats were rightly outraged” by nationwide injunctions against abortion medication.

Brooks began by saying, “I think the patchwork argument is the best argument the people in favor of the national injunction have, where the Constitution’s going to be interpreted differently in different regions, that doesn’t seem to make sense.”

He continued, “Nonetheless, I hate to say, I think the court decided rightly on the national injunctions. I remember back in the Biden administration, there was a judge in Amarillo, TX who decided to ban an abortion pill, and I thought it was just crazy that a single judge can set national policy on a fraught issue that should be settled by democracy. And Democrats were rightly outraged. Now, I am all in favor of judges stopping what the Trump administration is doing, but you’ve got to be consistent for both parties. And I think if people want to challenge what the Trump administration is doing or any administration, they can file class-action lawsuits. But we should not have this shopping where liberals go to a northern California liberal judge, conservatives go to an Amarillo, TX judge, and they can set national policy through one person.”"

No official source for the billionaire confirmed that a bee caused the heart attack.  Digital reached out to Sona Comstar for comment.
""It’s not possible to comment with any specificity about this particular case without a thorough review of the forensics,"" Dr. Nishant Kalra, an Ohio cardiologist and regional chief medical officer at VitalSolution — an Ingenovis Health company that offers cardiovascular and anesthesiology services to hospitals — told  Digital.
Swallowing a bee can, in very rare cases, precipitate a heart attack, he confirmed — ""but only through specific mechanisms.""
The primary risk is not from the act of swallowing itself, but from the possibility of a bee sting to either the upper airway or the oropharynx (the part of the mouth that includes the back of the tongue, tonsils and soft palate), which can introduce venom into the body, according to Kalra.
Swallowing a bee can, in very rare cases, precipitate a heart attack, experts say. (iStock)
If the individual is allergic, this can trigger anaphylaxis, which may cause ""profound hypotension, arrhythmias or even acute coronary syndromes,"" Kalra said — a phenomenon known as Kounis syndrome. 
This syndrome can result from a coronary event (any adverse medical event related to the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart) occurring in combination with anaphylactic or allergic reactions. 
This can pose a risk even to individuals who do not have pre-existing coronary artery disease.

The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology notes that cardiac anaphylaxis can cause reduced blood flow to the heart (myocardial ischemia) and irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) when triggered by an allergy to insect venom.
However, these cases are incredibly rare, according to experts.
""The general population should not be concerned about this as a common risk,"" Kapur told  Digital. ""Fatal cardiac events following bee stings are rare and typically occur in individuals with known venom hypersensitivity or underlying cardiac disease.""
Most bee stings, even in the oropharynx, result in local reactions, though airway compromise is a concern if significant swelling occurs, he added.
Those who experience allergic symptoms following a sting should seek immediate medical attention."
right,"Police officers in Sacramento, California, recently put their lives on the line to rescue a suspect from extreme danger.

The incident happened on June 1 when the officers were in pursuit of a driver whose car police said was connected to an armed carjacking, ABC 10 reported on Friday.

Dashcam footage shows part of the brief chase when the car smashed into a chain-link fence and crashed onto airport property.

The suspect’s vehicle goes over a slight hill and seconds later a burst of flames is seen in the dark sky, the clip shared by the Sacramento Police Department shows.

“Vehicle’s on fire,” one officer is heard saying as he approaches the scene. Body camera footage then shows the officers climbing over the damaged chain-link fence to get to the car that was on fire:

Recently, our officers were in a brief pursuit of a suspect vehicle involved in a carjacking. After the pursuit ended in a crash, the suspect’s vehicle caught fire. Without hesitation, our officers ran toward the burning car and quickly pulled the driver to safety. Their calm, focused, and courageous actions reflect the professionalism and dedication our officers bring to every situation. Posted by Sacramento Police Department on Friday, June 27, 2025

The ABC 10 article named the officers who ran toward the danger: Keegan Hironaka, Nicholas Duncan, and Riley Start.

When they got close to the vehicle, the driver was heard screaming for help. The grass surrounding the car was also on fire and the officers acted quickly to get the driver out of the vehicle. Once an officer broke the window, the suspect reached out and the officers pulled him out of the burning car and helped him get to safety.

“Please, please help me! Please help me!” the suspect is heard saying over and over. The officers made sure no one else was in the car before handcuffing the suspect, whose legs were reportedly broken during the crash.

Officers were concerned about the fire reaching the gas tank and Duncan said, “It became more of a rescue mission, and we really, really wanted to make sure that we could get that person out of there and make sure that everyone was safe.”

The suspect is facing charges in the alleged carjacking and police pursuit.

Meanwhile, the officers said people have been calling them heroes for their actions but Start said, “I just feel like we’re doing our job.”

Duncan expressed how proud he felt in getting to work with his fellow officers who are so selfless, while Hironaka said he hopes the clip is a warning to citizens.

“I just want people to pull over when we turn on our lights,” he commented.

The police department said one of its core values is dedication. Their website states, “Public Safety is not just a job; it’s a calling. It means staying true to our mission despite challenges, judged not just by our actions but by the impact on those we serve.”

right,"Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., discusses President Donald Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ as the Senate scrambles to pass legislation before July 4 on ‘ Live.’
FIRST ON FOX: A House Republican representing part of Southern California will oppose President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" if it returns to her chamber without the House's original language on Medicaid, a source familiar with her thinking told  Digital.
Rep. Young Kim, R-Calif., is one of several moderates who are uneasy on Saturday after the Senate released updated text of the massive bill advancing Trump's agenda on tax, immigration, defense, energy, and the national debt.
Two other sources told  Digital that as many as 20 to 30 moderate Republicans are reaching out to Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., with serious concerns about the Senate's bill.
The source familiar with Kim's thinking said, ""As she’s said throughout this process, ‘I will continue to make clear that a budget resolution that does not protect vital Medicaid services for the most vulnerable, provide tax relief for small businesses, and address the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions will not receive my vote.'""

The Senate released the nearly 1,000-page bill minutes before midnight on Friday night.
It makes some notable modifications to the House's version of the bill – which passed that chamber by just one vote in May – particularly on Medicaid and green energy credits.
Among their issues is the difference in provider tax rates and state-directed payments, both of which states use to help fund their share of Medicaid costs.

Whereas the House bill called for freezing provider taxes at their current rates and blocking new ones from being implemented, the Senate's bill went a step further – forcing states to gradually phase down their provider tax rates to 3.5%, if they adopted the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) Medicaid expansion.
That would include 40 states and Washington, D.C. The Senate's most recent bill text shows that phase-down happening between 2028 and 2032.
Sixteen House GOP moderates wrote a letter to congressional leaders sounding the alarm on those Medicaid provisions earlier this week.

They said it ""undermines the balanced approach taken to craft the Medicaid provisions in H.R. 1—particularly regarding provider taxes and state-directed payments.""
""The Senate version treats expansion and non-expansion states unfairly, fails to preserve existing state programs, and imposes stricter limits that do not give hospitals sufficient time to adjust to new budgetary constraints or to identify alternative funding sources,"" the letter read.
To offset Senate Republicans' concerns about their chamber's proposed limits on state-directed payments and provider tax rates, the Senate Finance Committee included a $25 billion rural hospital fund in their legislation.
It was enough to sway Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who told reporters on Saturday that he would support the bill after expressing earlier concern about the Medicaid provisions' impact on rural hospitals.
But in the House, sources are signaling to  Digital that moderate Republicans could still need convincing if the bill passes the Senate this weekend.

It could pose problems for House GOP leaders given their thin three-vote majority, though it's worth noting that the legislation could still change before it reaches the lower chamber.
But one senior House GOP aide told  Digital they believe the moderates will ultimately fall in line, even if the text doesn't change.
""Moderate Republicans can plead and beg with House leadership all they want – the reforms to Medicaid made in the Senate are here to stay,"" the senior aide said. ""And ultimately, these lawmakers will roll over and vote for the ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ because the wrath of President Trump is far worse than a lower provider tax.""
 Digital reached out to Speaker Mike Johnson's office for comment.
For his part, Johnson, R-La., has publicly urged the Senate on multiple occasions to change the bill as little as possible – given the fragile unity that must be struck in the House to pass it."

A longtime critic of the Iranian clerical regime, Cotler has been under round-the-clock Royal Canadian Mounted Police protection since 2023 when Canadian intelligence officials identified a death threat against him from Iran.
""Iranian diaspora groups, human rights defenders, journalists, Jews and Israelis have all become potential targets,"" Cotler told  Digital in an interview. ""This is a moment in which we need to be on alert.""
He noted that this week, three political prisoners were executed in Iran over charges of espionage for Israel, and during the 12-day war with Israel, another 700 Iranians were arrested under allegations that they collaborated with Israel.
Montreal-born Cotler, an 85-year-old international human rights lawyer who established the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights 10 years ago, is trying to secure the release of Ahmadreza Djalali – a Swedish Iranian physician accused of being an Israeli spy, who had been imprisoned for nine years at Iran’s notorious Evin Prison in Tehran until this week when he was moved to an undisclosed location. He is facing what Cotler described as ""an imminent threat of execution.""

He fears that sleeper cells have been activated in Canada to target those who oppose the Iranian regime and is urging the Canadian government to prioritize the establishment of an independent agency to address external threats of repression and assassination from such rogue countries as Iran, China and Russia.
Cotler also noted that Iranian-born Canadian human rights lawyer Kaveh Shahrooz, who he said has also been targeted by the Iranian regime, believes the number of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) agents operating in Canada are ""underrepresented"" and ""that the threat is greater than we appreciate.""
 Digital was unable to reach Shahrooz for further comment.
Canada should also follow the lead of the U.S. Justice Department and prosecute those who collaborate with Iranian-led sleeper cells, said Cotler, who in 2008 called for the IRGC to be listed as a terrorist entity – a designation that Canada finally adopted in 2024.
Last October, the Justice Department formally accused Ruhollah Bazghandi, a senior IRGC official, of involvement in a 2022 plot to kill Iranian American dissident Masih Alinejad – a friend of Cotler’s – in New York City.

During a virtual news conference from the NATO summit at The Hague on Tuesday, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand said that her government is ""very concerned about [both] foreign interference, including the types that were highlighted by"" Cotler and ""about the Iranian regime,"" which is why she said that Canada declared it to be a ""terrorist entity"" in 2022 and has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since 2012.
Anand also said that she had a call with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi last Saturday before the U.S. airstrikes against Iran, during which she reaffirmed Canada’s continuing desire to seek accountability from the Islamic Republic for the downing of Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 in 2020, which resulted in the deaths of 55 Canadian citizens and 30 permanent residents.
Cotler said that the victims’ families in both Iran and Canada have been ""harassed and threatened"" since the air tragedy.
On Wednesday, The Globe and Mail reported that the Canada Border Services Agency had identified 20 people deemed inadmissible because they are believed to be senior Iranian officials."
right,"Kennedy Center director Ric Grenell weighs in on 'Hamilton' cancelling shows at the theater on 'Hannity.'
I’m sorry to report that the theater kids in the Democrat Party are at it again, this time quite literally and in Washington’s jewel of the performing arts, the Kennedy Center.
On Monday night, Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., put on the ""Love is Love"" concert co-hosted by Democrat Sens. Tammy Baldwin , of Wisconsin; Jacky Rosen, of Nevada; Brian Schatz, of Hawaii; and Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, as an affair to protest what they claim is anti-LGBT bias at the arts center.
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS HOST PRIDE CONCERT AT KENNEDY CENTER TO PROTEST TRUMP TAKEOVER
The show, featuring Broadway stars and a gay men’s chorus in the 144-seat Justice Forum was invitation only, and no, you were not invited.
It turns out Hickenlooper had reached out to Broadway producer Jeffrey Seller, to co-produce the show, the same Seller behind the hit musical ""Hamilton,"" and who recently canceled a production at the Kennedy Center, along with the show’s creator Lin Manuel-Miranda, also in protest against alleged anti-gay bias.

The senators used a little-known provision that allows them to rent space at the Kennedy Center as a perk of the job. Who knew?
Setting aside the fact that the merits of the claim that the Kennedy Center has somehow become anti-gay fall somewhere between wet tissue paper flimsy and non-existent, the form of this protest by powerful Democrats warrants some scrutiny, and can tell us a lot.
According to The New York Times, Hickenlooper reached out to Seller and asked if he wanted to make some ""guerrilla theater,"" which, for anyone who knows anything about theater, is absolutely hilarious.
Guerrilla theater, often associated with the Living Theater founded in 1947, is when a company just takes over a space and starts putting on a show. In the 1980s, they used to have stage lights they could plug into municipal light poles, for example.
What guerrilla theater is definitively and unquestionably not, is 5 of the most powerful human beings on earth asking a super-rich Broadway producer to put on a concert in one of the most venerated performance spaces in America that they can rent by Congressional prerogative.

That is, in fact, the perfect polar opposite of guerrilla theater.
This confusion by Hickenlooper and Seller is an incredibly illuminating window into the current mindset of the far-left elites in the Democrat Party and their cultural wingmen. They think they are being raw and edgy, when actually, they just look ridiculous.
We see this performative nonsense everywhere from Democrats, whether in Corey Booker’s farcical filibuster, Rep. Eric Swalwell’s cringeworthy TikTok skits, or elected officials getting themselves arrested on purpose for eager cameras.
They think all of these things, like their ""guerilla theater,"" are provocative and brave, a counter-culture that stands up to Trump and all his alleged crimes.
The Kennedy Center is seen Aug. 13, 2019, in Washington. 
What these prancing Democrats fail to understand is just how inauthentic their antics are to the everyday Americans who can see through them like Superman checking what's in the fridge without opening the door.
Democrats and their advisers have lost sight of the difference between symbolism and reality, Booker wasn’t filibustering any real bill, members of Congress aren’t really being arrested in any meaningful way, and 5 senators sure as hell did not really ""occupy"" the Kennedy Center.
Everybody knows it's all for show, because they have seen the show before.
Hickenlooper and Seller thought they were speaking their truth to the power of Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell, a gay man who they absurdly accuse of anti-gay bias because he wants the institution he leads to focus on artistic excellence instead of identity grievance.
In fact, it is Grennell and the new board of directors at the Kennedy Center who are pushing back against decades of hegemonic left-wing power in arts and culture, and at the slightest threat to its power, the political and artistic left has thrown a hissy fit.
Americans don’t need guerrilla theater from our elected officials, especially those who have no idea what guerrilla theater actually is.
Democrats need to wake up to the fact that just doing one more performative stunt isn’t going to convince Americans they are living in a fascist dictatorship and should come running back to their party.
While Republicans are tackling the budget and the border, the Democrats are making sure that gay people aren’t underrepresented in theater, which is like making sure that guys named ""Cheech"" aren’t underrepresented in the mafia.
The American people have no idea who leads the Democrats, what they stand for, or what policies they would enact, it is my job to know these things and I don’t even know, because they won’t tell us.
For now at least, the theater kids are gonna be theater kids, so keep your Playbills handy, you never know what mind numbingly awful show these Democrats may put on next."
right,"Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow’s forthcoming book, Breaking the Law, has rocketed up the Amazon charts since it was announced on Thursday. The two-time New York Times bestselling author spent a year investigating the lawfare “superstructure” that has been weaponized against Donald Trump and overtaken American politics. Now, the book is topping at least one category on Amazon and ranked #3 on the “Movers & Shakers” list.

Amazon “Movers & Shakers” tracks the books that have seen the biggest gains in sales over a 24-hour window. Marlow trailed only a forthcoming poetry book from Hollywood actor Matthew McConaughey and a book on cooking.

Breaking the Law: Exposing the Weaponization of America’s Legal System Against Donald Trump also topped the Political Conservatism and Liberalism category and tracked near the top of several others, as of early Saturday.

“All praise to the Breitbart News audience,” Marlow said. “This book has been kept entirely under wraps until Thursday, and only announced to the Breitbart audience at this time. To see it soar on Amazon is all thanks to this community we have built at Breitbart News over the past two decades.”

“Virtually every case, every instance of lawfare that I scrutinized for this book, is far worse than you have ever imagined,” The Alex Marlow Show podcast host continued, “and I’m extremely eager to get these findings out there into the public.” “It is time to fight back.”

Marlow, who was Andrew Breitbart’s first employee when he was 21-years-old, has been EIC of the conservative web pioneer’s namesake website since 2013.

“I have spent the last year poring over documents and information and compiling what I believe is the definitive takedown of the left’s lawfare superstructure that has been on a mission to destroy Donald Trump and his movement,” Marlow told Breitbart News, noting that he conducted interviews with top conservative scholars, members of Trump’s legal team, and the president himself.

“I wrote Breaking the Law because I want this country to survive lawfare. The institutional left is not messing around. They are trying to use it as a tool to destroy America,” Marlow added.

President Trump echoed those sentiments in a glowing endorsement:

“This book is a must read. It shows how corrupt our judicial system is in our country,” President Trump told Marlow during a meeting in the Oval Office. “Cases are rigged left and right. Judge shopping is rampant at levels never seen before. You know the outcome of a case as soon as the judge is picked. And the radical left is using this, their final weapon, to take down America.”

“This book is one way to fight back,” Marlow said. “It’s my honor to have your support.”

Breaking the Law is available for pre-order now. It will also be available on eReader and audiobook read by the author himself."
right,"Socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is not shy about playing race and class cards in his campaign platform proposal to hike property taxes for “richer and whiter neighborhoods.”

Calling it a “soak-the-rich” proposal, the New York Post described the platform as an effort to fix the city’s “notoriously skewed property tax system,” where high-end brownstones are assessed at lower rates than homes and rentals in lower-income neighborhoods.

The race-based language is contained in Mamdani’s extensive “Stop the Squeeze on NYC Homeowners” campaign material.

It promises that a Mamdani administration will:

Shift the tax burden from overtaxed homeowners in the outer boroughs to more expensive homes in richer and whiter neighborhoods: The property tax system is unbalanced because assessment levels are artificially capped, so homeowners in expensive neighborhoods pay less than their fair share. The Mayor can fix this by pushing class assessment percentages down for everyone and adjusting rates up, effectively lowering tax payments for homeowners in neighborhoods like Jamaica and Brownsville while raising the amount paid in the most expensive Brooklyn brownstones.

The Post account acknowledged that “Democrats and many Republicans have long pushed to fix the out-of-whack system that ends up hitting poorer, often largely black and brown neighborhoods, with higher property taxes than their neighbors in swanky areas that tend to be majority Caucasian.”

But the candidate’s language drew fire from conservative critics.

Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon threatened to investigate Zohran Mamdani over his proposal to tax ‘whiter neighborhoods’ if he becomes the mayor, calling race-based policies “illegal.”

One former northeast resident, now a Florida-based commentator, called the candidate a “racist” on X.

City Councilman David Carr (R-Staten Island), who is part of a bipartisan push to reform the property tax system, said the inflammatory language doesn’t help the cause.

The Republican councilman told the Post:

The objective of our reforms is to make our property tax system fairer and more transparent and to ensure that middle-and-working-class homeowners aren’t subsidizing lower taxes for wealthy property owners. It’s not about blaming people based on race or class or political affiliation, and if Zohran Mamdani wants to come on board, then he should drop the divisive rhetoric.

Mamdani, 33, is a two-term Queens assemblyman. He pulled off what many observers considered a stunning upset in Tuesday’s ranked-choice Democrat mayoral primary.

However, he did not garner the 50 percent of votes needed to win the primary outright.

Among the race’s losers was former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who was dealt a major blow to his attempted political comeback after resigning from the governorship over a sexual harassment scandal. But he reportedly has not withdrawn his name from the ballot for the general election.

Mamdani ran an unabashedly socialist campaign focused on making New York affordable. It featured clever and eye-catching clips on social media and demonstrated that Mamdani, his left-wing politics aside, clearly has political charisma.

“New York’s tangled property tax rules are the result of a 50-year-old court decision and state law that aims to prevent middle-class owners from being taxed out of their homes with a complicated set of overlapping rules,” The Post reported,

New Yorkers in affluent neighborhoods are already objecting to the Mamdani proposal.

Ron Centola, a 73-year old retiree who has rented on the Upper East Side for 30 years, told the Post he opposes redistributing wealth.

“Here’s the thing, I’m wealthy, I don’t want my wealth redistributed,” he said Friday. “I work for my money, why should I give it away?”

right,"’ Christina Coleman discusses how ‘Oppenheimer’ director Christopher Nolan says there are ‘strong parallels’ between AI and nuclear weapons on ‘The Story.’
Prolific filmmaker James Cameron called the movie ""Oppenheimer"" a ""moral cop-out"" because it did not show the aftermath of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
""Yeah, it’s interesting what he stayed away from. Look, I love the filmmaking, but I did feel that it was a bit of a moral cop-out,"" Cameron said in an interview with Deadline.
Cameron, best known for ""Titanic,"" ""The Terminator,"" and ""Avatar,"" is currently developing a film called ""Ghosts of Hiroshima,"" to depict the devastation of J. Robert Oppenheimer’s nuclear weapon that struck Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945.
TRUMP, HEGSETH SEETHE AT 'FAKE NEWS' MEDIA FOR DOUBTING US STRIKES OBLITERATED IRANIAN NUCLEAR SITES: 'SCUM'
Prolific filmmaker James Cameron called the movie ""Oppenheimer"" a ""moral cop-out"" because it did not show the aftermath of the Japanese bombing. 
While discussing his new project, Cameron criticized ""Oppenheimer"" director Christopher Nolan’s creative choice to leave out the effects of the bombing of Hiroshima. 
Deadline added that in Cameron’s view, ""the choice to keep ‘Oppenheimer’ locked within its protagonist’s perspective was a misstep, and one that, he suggests, sidesteps the full weight of the bomb’s real-world consequences.""
""Because it’s not like Oppenheimer didn’t know the effects. He’s got one brief scene in the film where we see — and I don’t like to criticize another filmmaker’s film – but there’s only one brief moment where he sees some charred bodies in the audience, and then the film goes on to show how it deeply moved him,"" Cameron said.
""But I felt that it dodged the subject. I don’t know whether the studio or Chris felt that that was a third rail that they didn’t want to touch, but I want to go straight at the third rail.""
'TERMINATOR' DIRECTOR JAMES CAMERON FLIP-FLOPS ON AI, SAYS HOLLYWOOD IS 'LOOKING AT IT ALL WRONG'

Nolan had previously addressed criticism of his decision not to show the Hiroshima bombing in 2023, the year the film was released.
""The film presents Oppenheimer's experience subjectively,"" Nolan said. 
""It was always my intention to rigidly stick to that. Oppenheimer heard about the bombing at the same time that the rest of the world did. I wanted to show somebody who is starting to gain a clearer picture of the unintended consequences of his actions. It was as much about what I don't show as what I show.""
Spike Lee also criticized the decision, saying, ""If it's three hours, I would like to add some more minutes about what happened to the Japanese people. People got vaporized. Many years later, people are radioactive.""
""Oppenheimer"" earned 13 Academy Award nominations, making it one of the most-nominated movies in Oscars history.
Christopher Nolan, winner of the awards for best director and best picture for ""Oppenheimer,"" left, and Emma Thomas, winner of the award for best picture for ""Oppenheimer"" pose at the Governors Ball after the Oscars on Sunday, March 10, 2024, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.  
Universal's World War II biopic was also the third highest-grossing movie of 2023, earning $951 million. It was part of a summer phenomenon called ""Barbenheimer,"" which refers to theatergoers who opted to see both the deadly serious ""Oppenheimer"" and the more bubbly ""Barbie"" movie after both films were released in July.
""Ghosts of Hiroshima"" does not have a set release date yet.

That prompted the roommate to call him out.
""Now he's calling me petty and says I'm 'killing the vibe,'"" the original poster wrote. ""I'm not his parent.""
The man turned to social media users to help him determine if he was in the wrong for being ""territorial"" about his food in the shared living space.
""We are roommates, not life partners.""
He received overwhelming support — with some 1,300 positive ""upvote"" clicks on the post.
""If he doesn't replace what he uses, then has a hissy [fit] about you no longer making those items available to him, then he knows he is taking advantage of it and is just mad you set the boundary,"" one commenter said. 
""What a sense of entitlement that he actually complains when he can no longer take your things,"" another Redditor said.
Some people recommended hypothetical responses that the 31-year-old could give his mooching roommate.

""I'd be asking what his contribution to 'the vibe' was,"" a social media user wrote.
Another offered, ""You mean the vibe of you stealing my groceries? Yeah, I'm killing that vibe for sure.""
""We are roommates, not life partners,"" yet another said. 
Some suggested the original poster show the apartment mate what ""petty"" really looks like.
""Start 'accidentally' wearing his clothes,"" one person commented. 
""Being petty would be putting your milk back in the fridge once it's gone off, or switching sugar for salt,"" another said. ""I might be that petty.""
Many Reddit users shared personal experiences with similar roommate disputes, many of which also involved snack-snatchers grabbing their groceries. 
The Redditor said his roommate was even using his milk and coffee and never paying him back for the items. (iStock)
""It can only work when nobody in the house is a thieving a--hole, and everyone agrees on whatever [the] parameters [are],"" one person advised. 
Of the more than 150 responses, there was only one vote against the original poster.
""Grow a spine and tell him off,"" the response read.
""Grow a spine and tell him off,"" one Redditor told the man who accused his roommate (not pictured) of ""accidentally"" stealing his eggs and other groceries. (iStock)
But Lisa Mirza Grotts, an etiquette expert in San Francisco, California, disagreed with that advice.
""A closed mouth avoids open regret,"" Grotts told  Digital. ""He used non-verbal communication to correct the wrong.""

Taking without asking or without compensating is the ""ultimate roommate faux pas,"" she added. 
""Shared spaces demand mutual respect, especially when there's an agreement in place,"" Grotts continued. ""It may not be a legal contract, but it's a social one.""
Grotts offered a golden rule for roommates: ""If you wouldn't borrow it from a neighbor without asking, don't borrow it from a roommate."""
right,"Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses Elon Musk's possible priorities as he exits his role with the White House and explains the urgent warning for iPhone users to update devices following a 'massive security gap.'
Over the past decade, software companies have built solutions for nearly every industry, including healthcare. One term you might be familiar with is software as a service (SaaS), a model by which software is accessed online through a subscription rather than installed on individual machines. 
In healthcare, SaaS providers are now a common part of the ecosystem. But, recently, many of them have made headlines for the wrong reasons. 
Several data breaches have been traced back to vulnerabilities at these third-party service providers. The latest incident comes from one such firm, which has now confirmed that hackers stole the health information of over 5 million people in the United States during a cyberattack in January.

Episource, a big name in healthcare data analytics and coding services, has confirmed a major cybersecurity incident (via Bleeping Computer). The breach involved sensitive health information belonging to over 5 million people in the United States. The company first noticed suspicious system activity Feb. 6, 2025, but the actual compromise began ten days earlier.
An internal investigation revealed that hackers accessed and copied private data between Jan. 27 and Feb. 6. The company insists that no financial information was taken, but the stolen records do include names, contact details, Social Security numbers, Medicaid IDs and full medical histories.
Episource claims there’s no evidence the information has been misused, but because they haven’t seen the fallout yet doesn’t mean it isn’t happening. Once data like this is out, it spreads fast, and the consequences don’t wait for official confirmation.

The healthcare industry has embraced cloud-based services to improve efficiency, scale operations and reduce overhead. Companies like Episource enable healthcare payers to manage coding and risk adjustment at a much larger scale. But this shift has also introduced new risks. When third-party vendors handle patient data, the security of that data becomes dependent on their infrastructure.
Healthcare data is among the most valuable types of personal information for hackers. Unlike payment card data, which can be changed quickly, medical and identity records are long-term assets on the dark web. These breaches can lead to insurance fraud, identity theft and even blackmail.
Episource is not alone in facing this kind of attack. In the past few years, several healthcare SaaS providers have faced breaches, including Accellion and Blackbaud. These incidents have affected millions of patients and have led to class-action lawsuits and stricter government scrutiny.

5.5 MILLION PATIENTS EXPOSED BY MAJOR HEALTHCARE DATA BREACH
If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it’s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.
1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it’s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. 
These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it’s compromised. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.
2. Use personal data removal services: The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.  
One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 
Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.
3. Have strong antivirus software: Hackers have people’s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you’re not careful. However, you’re not without defenses.
The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.
4. Enable two-factor authentication: While passwords weren’t part of the data breach, you still need to enable two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.
5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.
What makes this breach especially alarming is that many of the affected patients may have never even heard of Episource. As a business-to-business vendor, Episource operates in the background, working with insurers and healthcare providers, not with patients directly. The people affected were customers of those companies, yet it's their most sensitive data now at risk because of a third party they never chose or trusted. This kind of indirect relationship muddies the waters when it comes to responsibility and makes it even harder to demand transparency or hold anyone accountable.

right,"The families of remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas appeared to be making a full court press with officials and lawmakers this week by urging the release of all the captives in Gaza, hoping to capitalize on President Donald Trump’s success with the Iran-Israel ceasefire in the 12 day war.

Over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held his first official meeting in Washington D.C. with the group, known as the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.

“True victory in Gaza will only be realized when all the hostages return home,” Rubio reportedly told the group.

In the meeting, Rubio, who also serves as the president’s National Security Adviser, reaffirmed the administration’s commitment to securing the release of all 50 remaining hostages, according to a press release from the forum.

Posting as Bring Them Home Now on X, the forum also has a website with a counter that tracks the hostages’ days in captivity. The lobbying group was formed after Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel when more than 300 were kidnapped.

The statement X expressed the forum’s message to the secretary for the Trump administration:

The families emphasized that this is a critical window of opportunity to bring all 50 hostages home in one comprehensive deal — with no phases or partial agreements. They expressed trust in the Trump administration to act with urgency and determination.

“We’ve waited long enough,” they added. “It’s time to make brave decisions and bring all our loved ones back — all at once.”

Rubio emphasized to the group that the United States has already demonstrated its ability to lead significant initiatives in the Middle East. He said that Israel has achieved victories in Iran and Lebanon and is capable of defeating Hamas as well, according to the statement.

Rubio’s wife, Jeanette, and son, Anthony, were also at the meeting,  reported.

Earlier this week, hostage families demonstrated outside Congress, distributing flyers with the faces of the remaining hostages to some 150 lawmakers, the Jerusalem Post reported. They also called upon President Donald Trump to make a deal securing the hostages’ release.

The forum later said in a statement, “The ceasefire agreement must expand to include Gaza; we call on the government to engage in urgent negotiations that will bring home all the hostages and end the war. Those who can achieve a ceasefire with Iran can also end the war in Gaza.”"

It was the team's first game at home since the Diamondbacks’ 4-1 win over the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday when a fan shouted derogatory comments about Marte’s late mother, Elpidia Valdez. She died in a car crash in the Dominican Republic in 2017.
The comments brought Marte to tears, and the star second baseman was consoled on the mound by Diamondbacks’ manager Torey Lovullo during a pitching change.

right,"A T-shirt worn by Beyoncé during a Juneteenth performance on her “Cowboy Carter” tour has sparked a discussion over how Americans frame their history and caused a wave of criticism for the Houston-born superstar.

The T-shirt worn during a concert in Paris featured images of the Buffalo Soldiers, who belonged to Black U.S. Army units active during the late 1800s and early 1900s. On the back was a lengthy description of the soldiers that included “Their antagonists were the enemies of peace, order and settlement: warring Indians, bandits, cattle thieves, murderous gunmen, bootleggers, trespassers, and Mexican revolutionaries.”

Images of the shirt and videos of the performance are also featured on Beyoncé’s website.

As she prepares to return to the U.S. for performances in her hometown this weekend, fans and Indigenous influencers took to social media to criticize Beyoncé for framing Native Americans and Mexican revolutionaries as anything but the victims of American imperialism and promoting anti-Indigenous language.

A publicist for Beyoncé did not respond to requests for comment.

Who were the Buffalo Soldiers?

The Buffalo Soldiers served in six military units created after the Civil War in 1866. They were comprised formerly enslaved men, freemen, and Black Civil War soldiers and fought in hundreds of conflicts — including in the Spanish-American War, World War I, and World War II — until they were disbanded in 1951.

As the quote on Beyoncé’s shirt notes, they also fought numerous battles against Indigenous peoples as part of the U.S. Army’s campaign of violence and land theft during the country’s westward expansion.

Some historians say the moniker “Buffalo Soldiers” was bestowed by the tribes who admired the bravery and tenacity of the fighters, but that might be more legend than fact. “At the end of the day, we really don’t have that kind of information,” said Cale Carter, director of exhibitions at the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum in Houston.

Carter and other museum staff said that, only in the past few years, the museum made broader efforts to include more of the complexities of the battles the Buffalo Soldiers fought against Native Americans and Mexican revolutionaries and the role they played in the subjugation of Indigenous peoples. They, much like many other museums across the country, are hoping to add more nuance to the framing of American history and be more respectful of the ways they have caused harm to Indigenous communities.

“We romanticize the Western frontier,” he said. “The early stories that talked about the Buffalo Soldiers were impacted by a lot of those factors. So you really didn’t see a changing in that narrative until recently.”

There has often been a lack of diverse voices discussing the way Buffalo Soldiers history is framed, said Michelle Tovar, the museum’s director of education. The current political climate has put enormous pressure on schools, including those in Texas, to avoid honest discussions about American history, she said.

“Right now, in this area, we are getting push back from a lot of school districts in which we can’t go and teach this history,” Tovar said. “We are a museum where we can at least be a hub, where we can invite the community regardless of what districts say, invite them to learn it and do what we can do the outreach to continue to teach honest history.”

Historians scrutinize reclamation motive

Beyoncé’s recent album “Act II: Cowboy Carter” has played on a kind of American iconography, which many see as her way of subverting the country music genre’s adjacency to whiteness and reclaiming the cowboy aesthetic for Black Americans. Last year, she became the first Black woman ever to top Billboard’s country music chart, and “Cowboy Carter” won her the top prize at the 2025 Grammy Awards, album of the year.

“The Buffalo Soldiers play this major role in the Black ownership of the American West,” said Tad Stoermer, a historian and professor at Johns Hopkins University. “In my view, (Beyoncé is) well aware of the role that these images play. This is the ‘Cowboy Carter’ tour for crying out loud. The entire tour, the entire album, the entire piece is situated in this layered narrative.”

But Stoermer also points out that the Buffalo Soldier have been framed in the American story in a way that also plays into the myths of American nationalism.

As Beyoncé’s use of Buffalo Soldiers imagery implies, Black Americans also use their story to claim agency over their role in the creation of the country, said Alaina E. Roberts, a historian, author and professor at Pittsburgh University who studies the intersection of Black and Native American life from the Civil War to present day.

“That’s the category in which she thought maybe she was coming into this conversation, but the Buffalo Soldiers are even a step above that because they were literally involved in not just the settlement of the West but of genocide in a sense,” she said.

Online backlash builds ahead of Houston shows

Several Native influencers, performers, and academics took to social media this week to criticize Beyoncé or call the language on her shirt anti-Indigenous. “Do you think Beyoncé will apologize (or acknowledge) the shirt,” indigenous.tv, an Indigenous news and culture Instagram account with more than 130,000, asked in a post Thursday.

Many of her critics, as well as fans, agree. A flood of social media posts called out the pop star for the historic framing on the shirt.

“The Buffalo Soldiers are an interesting historical moment to look at. But we have to be honest about what they did, especially in their operations against Indigenous Americans and Mexicans,” said Chisom Okorafor, who posts on TikTok under the handle @confirmedsomaya.

Okorafor said there is no “progressive” way to reclaim America’s history of empire building in the West, and that Beyoncé’s use of Western symbolism sends a problematic message.

“Which is that Black people too can engage in American nationalism,” she said. “Black people too can profit from the atrocities of American empire. It is a message that tells you to abandon immigrants, Indigenous people, and people who live outside of the United States. It is a message that tells you not only is it a virtue to have been born in this country but the longer your line extends in this country the more virtuous you are.”"

Washington, 73, has been sidelined for the last week after he experienced shortness of breath at the end of the Angels’ series against the New York Yankees that ended on June 19. 
Following that series, Washington flew back to Southern California and was placed on medical leave after he underwent a series of tests. Washington is currently the oldest manager in MLB.

Washington was hired by the Angels prior to the 2024 season, and is 103-140 in 243 games with the team. He was the manager of the Texas Rangers for eight seasons (2007-2014) and had a 664-611 record with them.
He led the Rangers to back-to-back World Series appearances in 2010 and 2011 before stepping down abruptly in September 2014.
The Angels are 40-41 on the season, and have a 7-4 record with Montgomery at the helm.

right,"host Jesse Watters reacts to raw footage of former Vice President Kamala Harris CBS interview on Jesse Watters Primetime.
The infamous ""60 Minutes"" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris that sparked President Donald Trump’s $20 billion ""election interference"" lawsuit conflicted with Walter Cronkite-era CBS News guidelines. 
Cronkite, who was the face of ""CBS Evening News"" from 1962 to 1981, was the premier anchorman of America’s golden age of network news. In 1976, at the height of Cronkite’s reign as ""the most trusted man in America,"" CBS News president Richard Salant penned a 76-page document outlining CBS News standards. 
Page 58 is focused on editing and suggests the ""60 Minutes"" interview at the center of Trump’s lawsuit against CBS News would have been frowned upon during the Cronkite era. 
""The objective of the editing process is to produce a clear and succinct statement which reflects fairly, honestly and without distortion what was seen and heard by our reporters, cameras and microphones,"" Salant wrote in the 1976 document, which has come to the attention of the Trump legal team.

Trump’s lawsuit alleges CBS News deceitfully edited an exchange Harris had with ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't ""listening"" to the Biden administration. Harris was criticized for the ""word salad"" answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on ""Face the Nation."" 
However, when the same question aired during a primetime special on the network, she gave a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of editing her answer to shield the Democratic nominee from further backlash leading up to Election Day.
The raw transcript and footage released earlier this year by the FCC showed that both sets of Harris' comments came from the same lengthy response, but CBS News had aired only the first half of her response in the ""Face the Nation"" preview clip and aired the second half during the primetime special.

CBS News, which has denied any wrongdoing and stands by the broadcast and its reporting, did not immediately respond to  Digital when asked if the Cronkite-era standards have changed. 
""If more than one excerpt from a speech or statement is included in a documentary broadcast, the order of their inclusion in the broadcast will be the same as the order of their inclusion in the speech or statement, unless the broadcast specifically indicates otherwise,"" Salant wrote in the 1976 CBS News Standards guide.
When Cronkite died in 2009 at age 92, his Associated Press obituary said the famed anchor ""valued accuracy, objectivity and understated compassion"" and ""always aimed to be fair and professional in his judgments"" regardless of personal views on a topic. 
Two polls pronounced Cronkite the ""most trusted man in America"": a 1972 ""trust index"" survey in which he finished No. 1, about 15 points higher than leading politicians, and a 1974 survey in which people chose him as the most trusted television newscaster, according to the AP.

Salant, who was running CBS News when ""60 Minutes"" was launched, was lauded by The New York Times when he died in 1993. 
""He was credited with raising professional standards and expanding news programming at CBS,"" the Times wrote. 
CBS News, along with parent company Paramount, are currently in mediation with hopes of settling with Trump. The mediator recently proposed the network end the president's $20 billion lawsuit with a $20 million settlement, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
Last month, Trump rejected Paramount's $15 million settlement offer as he sought at least a $25 million payout as well as an apology. According to the Wall Street Journal, Paramount ""isn’t prepared"" to give one."

right,"SANTA FE, N.M.  — A settlement has been reached in the civil lawsuit alleging negligence in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of the Western movie “Rust”, according to court documents released Friday.

The lawsuit was brought by three “Rust” crew members seeking compensation for emotional distress from producers of “Rust,” including Alec Baldwin as co-producer and lead actor.

The civil suit accused producers of failing to follow industry safety rules — allegations they denied.

Terms of the settlement were not available. Attorneys for “Rust” producers and the plaintiffs could not immediately be reached by phone or email.

Plaintiffs to the lawsuit included Ross Addiego, a front-line crew member who witnessed at close range the fatal shooting of Halyna Hutchins at close during a rehearsal on October 2021 on a filmset ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe.

A charge of involuntary manslaughter against Baldwin was dismissed at trial last year on allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.

Separately, “Rust” armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and completed an 18-month sentence in May. Prosecutors accused Gutierrez-Reed of unwittingly bringing live ammunition on set and failing to follow basic gun safety protocols.

Baldwin was pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal on a movie set outside Santa Fe when the revolver went off, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza.

Addiego testified at Gutierrez-Reed’s trial and appeared before the grand jury that indicted Baldwin.

The filming of “Rust” was completed in Montana. The Western was released in theaters in May."
right,"Lux Pascal, Chilean-American Hollywood actor Pedro Pascal’s youngest sibling, will play the lead role in the drama Miss Carbón (“Queen of Coal”), a Spanish-Argentine production based on the story of Carla Antonella Rodríguez, Argentina’s first transgender coal miner worker.

The film, released in Spanish theaters on June 12, will arrive domestically on Netflix this year and was directed by Agustina Macri, daughter of center-right former Argentine President Mauricio Macri.

The movie tells the story of Carla “Carlita” Antonella Rodríguez, a 33-year-old from Argentina. He was born as Carlos Enrique Rodríguez in Río Turbio — a small town of 11,000 people in the Argentine Patagonia, home to many of the country’s coal mines, the town’s main source of income. Rodríguez reportedly became “Argentina’s first woman coal mine worker” in 2011 and “defeated” an over 80-year-old superstition barring women from entering the Río Turbio coal mines.

“I consider myself a cautious person at first. I tend to read the situation before inserting myself into it,” Pascal, who is also transgender, told Vogue Spain this month. “I feel like I’m someone who takes one step at a time, and if I then feel I can run, I run.”

“The feature film also shows the moment when Argentina’s Gender Identity Law was signed into effect in 2012. An explosion of joy for the trans community and a milestone in Latin American history that was cut short in 2025, when Javier Milei, the country’s current president, amended the law to prevent people under the age of 18 from accessing gender affirmation care and restricted the accommodation of prisoners according to their identity,” Vogue Spain’s report read.

Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter this week, Pascal said to be initially afraid of taking the role but had a change of mind after meeting Rodríguez and reframing the story as one about “women in the workplace.”

“When I met her [Rodríguez], I was mesmerized by this air of disappointment of how the world has treated her,” Pascal said. “I didn’t want to shy away from showing how sometimes that sadness is just impossible to hide.”

Agustina Macri told the outlet Infobae this month that Pascal was always the first choice for the lead role and stressed that, “to me, she has a very powerful intuition and is very intelligent. As a trans woman, she has a background and a look at life and the character that I perhaps don’t have.”

According to Infobae, women were barred from working at the Río Turbio coal mines due to an over 80-year-old urban myth that stated that a woman had once gone into the mines to look for her husband after a collapse. The myth claims that her “spirit” was locked up there and, for that reason, some miners “disappeared after being seduced by that female presence that they called the ‘black widow.’”

“For that reason, women were never allowed to enter the mines, much less work in them. They could only enter on St. Barbara’s Day, December 4, when the title of ‘Queen of Coal’ was celebrated,” Infobae said.

“Things of life, instead of coming to me through him, it came through a producer who told me that this project was going around in Argentina and that she thought I would be interested in it. He sent me the script, but as soon as he summarized it to me with a couple of sentences, it already seemed like an incredible story,” Macri said.

Matty Healy, lead singer for the British rock band The 1975, told fans at the Glastonbury Festival set on Friday night that the group would no longer be infusing politics into their live performances. Despite Healy's assertion, politically charged visuals soon appeared. 
The rocker addressed the crowd after their opening tracks and noted that while some may be disappointed in the ""lack of politics"" during their set, telling fans the band wants to move on and ensure their legacy ""won't be one of politics.""
""People who are watching this may — I don’t know — they may be disappointed in the lack of politics in this show and our forthcoming shows and probably our future shows. I want you to know that it’s a conscious decision,"" he told the crowd. ""We honestly don’t want our legacy to be one of politics. We want it to be that of love and friendship. I’m not trying to be too earnest, but you can go out into the world and there’s loads of politics everywhere. And I think we don’t need more politics. We need more love and friendship.""

The singer called his comments ""really basic,"" but lobbied the audience to ""aspire to this level of friendship."" 
Following the speech, it only took the band one song before politics made an appearance.
As noted by Variety, ""Love It if We Made It,"" one of the band's most politically charged songs, was accompanied by a montage displaying images of President Donald Trump, Kanye West and depictions of the plights of immigrants.
Healy, who is an ex-boyfriend of Taylor Swift, is no stranger to controversy. He landed the group in hot water in 2023 after he kissed the band's guitarist, Ross MacDonald, on-stage in Malaysia to protest the country's anti-LGBTQ laws.

Not only did the moment result in the three-day festival they were playing at being canceled and the band being banned from performing in Malaysia, it may have had a negative impact on the country's LGBTQ-identifying citizens.
As reported by Variety, some locals feared that the band's actions could lead to a further crackdown by the government on its gay citizens.
In response to the incident, a spokesperson for the band told Variety: ""Matty has a long-time record of advocating for the LGBTQ+ community, and the band wanted to stand up for their LGBTQ+ fans and community.""
According to the entertainment site NME.com, Healy cried when Trump won in 2016. He added, ""I was tired and we felt a bit defeated."""
right,"Singer-songwriter Rod Stewart has become the latest prominent British celebrity to endorse Nigel Farage as his Reform UK party seeks to upend the political establishment in London.

It is time to “give Farage a chance” at governing the country, according to Maggie May singer Rod Stewart.

Speaking to The Times of London, Sir Rod said that while he is “extremely wealthy”, he said that it “doesn’t mean I’m out of touch”.

“For instance, I’ve read about Starmer cutting off the fishing in Scotland and giving it back to the EU. That hasn’t made him popular. We’re fed up with the Tories,” he said.

“Starmer’s all about getting us out of Brexit, and I don’t know how he’s going to do that. Still, the country will survive. It could be worse. We could be in the Gaza Strip,” the British rocker added.

“We’ve got to give Farage a chance. He’s coming across well… What options have we got? I know some of his family, I know his brother, and I quite like him,” Stewart said.

The 80-year-old rocker went on to lament the current state of Britain’s infrastructure, citing the prevalence of potholes on UK roads.

“As I travel in Italy, Germany, nowhere else is as bad. Starmer has promised to spend millions on it … We shall see,” Stewart said.

Relaying an incident in 2022 when he was filmed personally filling potholes, he said: “I took me Ferrari out. Nearly lost the f***ing wheel… And before I did in the Ferrari I saw an ambulance that couldn’t move, the wheel stuck right in there.

“So I took me mates out, and we knew what to do because I had builders in the house. We filled in a considerable length of the road, actually.”

Sir Rod is just the latest high-profile celebrity to back Farage and his upstart Reform UK party. In April, Chopping Block celebrity chef Marco Pierre White threw his support behind the Brexit boss, saying that he found Farage to be a “very impressive individual”.

Farage has also secured the backing of figures such as British heavyweight boxer Dereck Chisora and former soap actress Holly Vallance."

The drugs, valued at 96 million pounds ($132 million), were found under containers on a vessel at London Gateway port, east of the British capital. The shipment was discovered after what officials said was an intelligence-led operation.

Britain’s interior ministry, the Home Office, said it was the sixth-largest cocaine seizure on record.

U.K. Border Force Maritime director Charlie Eastaugh said the seizure was “just one example of how dedicated Border Force maritime officers remain one step ahead of the criminal gangs who threaten our security.

“Our message to these criminals is clear – more than ever before, we are using intelligence and international law enforcement co-operation to disrupt and dismantle your operations.”

The Justice Department, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, has abruptly fired at least three federal prosecutors involved in cases stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, according to multiple reports.
Among those dismissed were two supervisory attorneys who oversaw Capitol riot prosecutions in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, D.C., and a line prosecutor directly involved in trying several related cases, according to the Associated Press, citing sources familiar with the matter. NBC News is also reported to have independently confirmed the firings.

BONDI'S DOJ DAY 1 DIRECTIVES: FIGHT WEAPONIZATION OF JUSTICE, ELIMINATE CARTELS, LIFT DEATH PENALTY BAN
The prosecutors received termination letters signed by Bondi. According to both outlets, the letters provided no specific reason for the removals, citing only ""Article II of the United States Constitution and the laws of the United States."" That phrase is often used in federal employment law to indicate the executive branch’s constitutional authority to appoint or remove personnel.
 Digital contacted the Justice Department for confirmation and comment but did not immediately receive a response.
President Trump has repeatedly referred to the Jan. 6 defendants as political prisoners. On his first day back in the White House in January 2025, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of approximately 1,500 individuals who had been convicted or were incarcerated in connection with the Capitol attack.

In February, Attorney General Bondi ordered a review of the federal prosecution of Donald Trump and launched a broad internal audit aimed at ""realigning the Justice Department’s priorities"" in line with the White House agenda. That effort included the creation of a ""weaponization working group"" tasked with examining perceived ""politicized justice"" across federal law enforcement.

right,"LGBTQ+ activists and others took to the streets of Budapest on Saturday for a ‘Pride Parade’ despite the conservative government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán enacting a de facto ban on such demonstrations earlier this year.

Thousands gathered in the Hungarian capital on Saturday after Budapest Pride announced that they would continue to hold their annual parade, in defiance of legislation aimed at preventing public demonstrations that threaten the mental development of children, including exposing children to sexual or LGBTQ+ content.

According to Magyar Nemzet, the planned route for the parade passed by at least ten playgrounds, which families and young children often frequent.

Despite the police issuing a ban on the event this year, the organisers decided to proceed with the demonstration nonetheless. They were also supported by liberal Budapest Mayor Gergely Karácsony, who promoted the parade on social media with the message “freedom and love cannot be banned.”

Organisers of the event face criminal fines, potential jail time, and will be held responsible for any damages that come during the prohibited gathering.

Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whose party spearheaded the legislation banning such demonstrations, stated that while the police have the authority to forcibly disperse the parade, the government would likely opt to pursue legal consequences instead.

The issue has sparked widespread controversy throughout Europe, with fellow EU member states demanding Brussels impose additional sanctions on Hungary for supposedly failing to uphold the “human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people, including LGBTIQ+ persons,” which they claimed is “inherent in being part of the European family.”

This week, EU Chief Ursula von der Leyen also weighed in on the matter, calling on the Orbán government to allow the Pride Parade to occur “without fear of any criminal or administrative sanctions against the organisers or participants.”

“To the LGBTIQ+ community in Hungary and beyond: I will always be your ally,” she added.

In response, Prime Minister Orbán wrote: “I urge the European Commission to refrain from interfering in the law enforcement affairs of Member States, where it has no role to play.

“I also call on the Commission to focus its efforts on the pressing challenges facing the European Union—areas where it does have a clear role and responsibility, and where it has made serious mistakes in recent years, such as the energy crisis and the erosion of European competitiveness.”

According to a recent poll from the Nézőpont Institute, the majority of the Hungarian people back the Orbán government on the issue, with 51 per cent favouring restrictions on Pride Parades, compared to 43 per cent against."

""It's just a big team effort, and this is the second young person we helped get home in a week. And now we've got a couple of other folks that have reached out to our office, and we're hoping to be able to help them as well,"" McGuire told  Digital in an interview. 
McGuire celebrated McCready's homecoming as the fragile ceasefire deal between Iran and Israel had just begun. 
Questions remained about whether the ceasefire would hold when Trump announced on Monday evening that ""It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE.""

Trump said the U.S. successfully struck three nuclear sites in Iran on Saturday night, but questions remain on Capitol Hill as to what degree the strikes set back Iran's nuclear program. 
McGuire, a Trump loyalist who secured his endorsement in 2024, said the ""ability for Iran to project power has been greatly diminished.""
""We had an imminent threat of a nuclear weapon in Iran, and we just couldn't have that,"" McGuire added. ""That threat has been eliminated.""
Israel had launched a series of coordinated attacks on Iran on June 13, which Iran retaliated against, prompting the countries to exchange strikes for 12 days. After the U.S. struck Iran, the Islamic Republic launched retaliatory attacks on a U.S. air base in Qatar.

Following President Donald Trump's successful brokering of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, India and Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, critics say the U.N. secretary-general, António Guterres, could do well to follow Trump's lead as a peacemaker.
However, as American taxpayers still continue to pay billions to the United Nations, and while Trump outshines Guterres on the world stage, Guterres' base salary is more than the commander in chief’s.
At $418,348, Guterres earns a higher base salary than President Donald Trump while running a body accused of anti-American bias, corruption and waste.

""You flatter him right away,"" Dugan said, when comparing Guterres with Trump, ""when in fact he is one of the president’s employees – in fact, the employee of all the heads of state.

The spotlight on the salaries and perks comes at a time when the world body is facing serious financial constraints. 
Not including expenses and extras, Trump receives some $18,348 less than Guterres at $400,000. The presidential extras include a $50,000 expense allowance and other benefits. 
Guterres’ salary, provided to  Digital by his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, only includes his salary and multiplier. It does not include the considerable array of other benefits that Guterres enjoys. In an email to  Digital, Dujarric said the ""Net base salary as of Jan 2025 – $238,375 per year (reference resolution 58/265 adjusted in accordance with the same procedures as those applicable to staff in the Professional and higher categories).

While the U.S. doesn't directly pay the salary of the secretary-general, it does continue to fund around a quarter of the organization's budget, and critics continue to question outlays that they believe harm U.S. interests.

The mailers will be sent to homes in the area telling residents not to open their doors unless an officer has a valid warrant with a judge’s signature,  reported on Friday.

The news comes as President Donald Trump’s administration has been carrying out immigration enforcement which has resulted in ICE agents and police officers being harassed and targeted by violent leftists.

In her statement on the mailers, Council President Rachel Miller said, “The Providence City Council is partnering with organizations that represent our diverse community to promote safety and inclusion in the face of fear and uncertainty that pervades our city’s immigrant communities due to the reckless cruelty of the Trump administration.”

The Fox article said the city shelled out $17,000 for the mailer project.

It is important to note that Rhode Island is a sanctuary state where in 2022 an illegal MS-13 gang member from Guatemala who had escaped from police custody and whom police wanted for burglary was captured, per Breitbart News. In May 2024, Rhode Island freed from jail an illegal alien “got-away” from the Dominican Republic who was charged with sexually abusing a child in Providence, the outlet said at the time.

The Breitbart News article continued:

In November 2023, the illegal alien was arrested and charged in Providence on two counts of first-degree child molestation, one count of second-degree child molestation, and one count of first-degree sexual assault. Within two weeks, the illegal alien was allowed to post bail, and the Rhode Island Department of Corrections subsequently released him into the community. Rhode Island enforces a strict sanctuary state policy, enacted in 2014, which mandates law enforcement not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Months later, another illegal alien from Guatemala was accused of sexually assaulting a child in Rhode Island, per Breitbart News.

A recent Economist/YouGov survey found a majority believe it should be “illegal” for Americans to prevent ICE agents from doing their jobs. The news comes as left-wing groups have been publishing ICE agents’ locations in order to disrupt immigration enforcement, Breitbart News reported on June 6."

right,"On Friday’s broadcast of NPR’s “Morning Edition,” co-host Steve Inskeep argued that the DIA’s assessment in low confidence that NPR and other outlets reported on isn’t contradicted by the characterization that Iran’s nuclear program was damaged severely and significantly.

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) stated that while details are still emerging, “severe and significant damage would be the fair way to characterize this.”

Inskeep then said, “I appreciate that, and that doesn’t seem inconsistent with the Defense Intelligence Agency report that NPR has reported on and others have reported on that said, with low confidence, as they put it, that the military hit Fordow, that they did some damage, but that the Iranians might have moved uranium elsewhere just in time. Is that report that the White House has criticized, in fact, a decent bottom line for what the government knows at this point?”

Kaine responded, “Steve, again, that report is classified. I read it in a classified setting, and I don’t really want to talk about it. But let me just put it in this kind of a context: If the president, on Saturday night, had said, we have taken this action and we’ve caused severe and significant damage to the Iranian nuclear program, you wouldn’t have seen all this damage control over the damage for the last few days.

Auchincloss said, “Now that we have them in their weakest position in three decades, bring them to the negotiating table with one open hand and one closed fist and get to a deal that ensures a long-term status of no nuclear weapon program and no funding of proxy terror forces.”

He added, “Now is the time to engage in coercive diplomacy and get a longer and stronger version of the JCPOA, where you have, as you said, on the ground inspections, but also — and this is critical — also a deal that they will not be funding any of these terror forces in Lebanon, in Gaza, in Syria, and Iraq and Yemen, because if they do, we will sanction their oil exports or we will actually strike their oil fields.”"
right,"On Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s “AC360,” Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-MA) stated that Iran is “naked” to American and Israeli air power and so “they can’t do anything. They can’t clear that rubble away. They can’t try to reconstruct metalization plants without Israel or the United States just mowing the lawn again.” And that while Iran could have moved enriched uranium, “60% doesn’t mean weapons-grade 90%. It also doesn’t mean that it’s weaponizable. And there’s still a long way to go for Iran to get to that capability.”

Auchincloss stated, “There [are] two dimensions that matter here: There’s the capabilities and there’s the intention. Both before and after that briefing, I believe that Iran’s capabilities are significantly degraded, not just their capability to enrich uranium, but also their capability to weaponize that uranium. And, perhaps most importantly, their aerial defense capabilities, because, for so long as they are naked in front of Israel[i] and American air power, they can’t do anything. They can’t clear that rubble away. They can’t try to reconstruct metalization plants without Israel or the United States just mowing the lawn again. The more uncertain question is about their intention. And here is where coercive diplomacy is going to be critical.”

He further stated, “I’m not sure the White House believes that all that enriched uranium is buried underground. I think it’s pretty well understood that some of that enriched uranium could be moved. But, remember, 60% doesn’t mean weapons-grade 90%. It also doesn’t mean that it’s weaponizable. And there’s still a long way to go for Iran to get to that capability.

DeSantis said the facility — the Miami-Dade Collier Training Facility, which has been approved for use by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) — helps answer the mounting capacity issue due to the high rate of incarceration.

“There needs to be more ability to intake process and then deport. So this answers that,” the governor said. “This is going to be able to have — more than 3,000 illegals can be processed through here.

“We’ve got a massive runway right behind us where any of the federal assets… they want to fly these people back to the country,” he said, describing it as a “one stop shop.”

DeSantis said most of the illegal migrants will “likely be ones that are apprehended in Florida.”

“You know, we’ve got across this country about 750,000 illegals that have already been ordered to be removed by an immigration judge. We’ve probably got 50,000 or more in Florida, and so we’re going to have our hands full just with that,” he added, describing this as a “force multiplier.”

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier also described this detention facility as the “perfect location” for Florida’s needs assisting Trump in implementing his deportation agenda.

“It’s a 30 square mile area surrounded by the Everglades, an old abandoned airport with an 11,000 foot runway, already developed land,” he told Breitbart News Daily, explaining that they do not need to spend much on the perimeter because “Mother Nature provides it for us.”

“So we’re working hard to get thousands of beds up and running as quickly as we can to help the Trump administration do their job,” Uthmeier continued, hoping to have the facility operating by the beginning of July.

DeSantis said during his interview that the facility would be able to intake illegal migrants by Tuesday."
right,"The Trump administration’s pressure on University of Virginia (UVA) president James E. Ryan over the school’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives has resulted in the institution’s leader stepping down from his post.

In a letter to the university’s community, Ryan said his first inclination was to fight for what he believes in and that the school is one of those things,  reported on Saturday.

“But I cannot make a unilateral decision to fight the federal government in order to save my own job. To do so would not only be quixotic but appear selfish and self-centered to the hundreds of employees who would lose their jobs, the researchers who would lose their funding, and the hundreds of students who could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld,” he stated, noting that he had already decided next year would be his final one in the role.

President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice (DOJ) sent a demand letter to the university in May requiring leadership to confirm it had eliminated every aspect of DEI on its campuses, Breitbart News reported at the time.

The school’s governing board had previously voted to close down all DEI offices and end related programs, and Ryan was to report back to the board within 30 days to give an update. However, he apparently failed to meet the deadline, prompting the DOJ’s the demand letter.

After the board voted to nix DEI or risk losing federal funding, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) said the vote was for “common sense,” per NBC News.

“DEI is done at the University of Virginia. We stand for the universal truth that everyone is created equal, and opportunity is at the heart of Virginians’ and Americans’ future,” he stated.

Per the Fox report, Ryan’s resignation comes after Trump officials “privately demanded that the university remove Ryan to help resolve a Justice Department probe into the institution’s DEI practices, according to the New York Times.”

“The Justice Department argued that Ryan had failed to dismantle the school’s DEI programs and misrepresented the steps taken to eliminate them, amid the administration’s efforts to root out DEI in higher education,” the article stated.

In June 2023, Trump pledged to eliminate DEI programs across the federal government and enforce the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to strike down affirmative action in college admissions, according to Breitbart News. Prior to his historic comeback in winning the White House a second time, Trump vowed in 2024 to “reclaim” the education system from radical leftists.

Breitbart News coverage of UVA shows some outspoken students at the school lean left. In 2020, several of them made it clear they did not want white people using multicultural centers on campus, according to video footage from the Young America’s Foundation (YAF).

An opinion piece in the UVA student newspaper in 2020 called on fellow students to “stand up” to their “racist” relatives at Thanksgiving dinner, and a few years later the editorial board of UVA’s newspaper called for the removal of references to Founding Father Thomas Jefferson, who founded the school that is located in Charlottesville, per Breitbart News.

Ryan previously worked as the dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education and was recognized for his commitment to DEI initiatives, according to the Fox report."

A new poll from Pew Research Center highlighted President Donald Trump’s growing coalition of racially and ethnically diverse voters, Thursday. 
The Pew Research Center poll, which the organization calls ""a study of the 2024 election, based on validated voters,"" said that Trump made up extensive ground with Hispanic voters, Black voters and Asian voters. 
It found that Trump significantly closed the gap on Hispanic voters, with 51% of them going to former Vice President Kamala Harris, and 48% going to Trump, a significant shift from the 2020 presidential election, when Trump fell behind with Hispanic voters to former President Joe Biden, 61%-36%.

Asian voters, while still trending to the left with 57% supporting Harris, voted 40% for Trump, up from 2020, when 70% supported Biden and 30% went for Trump. 
The voters' level of education also played a role.

right,"After getting schlonged by President Trump in November, Democrats did what they always do after a big loss: entered a cocoon of denial. Post-election poll after poll showed 2024’s Big Loser, Kamala Harris, with a commanding lead over her closest rivals, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA).

What a difference six months can make.

Not only has Kamala Kollapsed in the latest poll of 2028 Democrat contenders, no one’s excited about her potential run for California governor.

And now we come to the poll… A poll that must have Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio going full bro with the high fives…

Failed former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg: 16 percent

Failed 2024 presidential contender Kamala Harris: 13 percent

Failed Gov. Gavin Newsom: 12 percent

Too Jewish-for-Antisemitic-Democrat-Party Gov. Josh Shapiro: 7 percent

Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy: 7 percent

That leaves 35 percent undecided.

That is the worst presidential bench of my lifetime.

We will take them one by one.

Buttigieg is the dweeby little weirdo handed $7.5 billion to build a national electric charging station infrastructure… and built only eight. And I don’t think, given the extremism of the gay movement, especially with the relentless targeting of children, America is ready for a gay president. Barack Obama doesn’t really count.

Kamala already lost once. She’s not smart. She doesn’t wear well. Above all, she doesn’t improve. After four years as vice president and four months as the Democrat party’s presidential choice, her political skills remained stuck on stupid.

Newsom is too much of an extremist leftist. Above all, “I’ll do for America what I did to California” is much more of a threat than a promise.

Shapiro is the Democrat party’s best chance, but, sadly, the party is ravaged by so much antisemitism it’s difficult to see the Jewish Shapiro winning the nomination.

Ocasio-Cortez has the political skills to become internet famous. It’s just hard to see her on a national stage transmitting the gravitas and poise required by successful presidential candidates.

Look at that Democrat bench compared to previous candidates who made it to the convention:

1992: Bill Clinton, Bob Kerrey, Tom Harkin, Paul Tsongas, Jerry Brown

2000: Al Gore, Bill Bradley

2004: John Kerry, John Edwards, Howard Dean, Wesley Clark

2008: Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton

2016: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders

2020: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Michael , Pete Buttigieg

While you can laugh at some of those names as lightweights, it’s nothing like the Armageddon facing Democrats today. And who’s the ringer? Who’s the Barry Obama waiting in the wings to emerge as a legitimate political athlete? Kathy Hochul? J.B. Pritzker? Hakeem Jeffries?

Meanwhile, look at the GOP bench: Vance, Rubio, Vivek Ramaswamy, Ron DeSantis — legitimate political athletes. A team-up of Vance and Rubio seems unbeatable right now.

This same poll shows Vance with 46 percent support for a 2028 presidential run, Rubio at 12 percent, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) at 9 percent, with only 17 percent undecided.

The usual caveats apply: an ill-timed recession, scandal, etc. The only thing certain in politics is the right now, and right now I’d much rather be us than them.

right,"Kurt ‘The CyberGuy’ Knutsson shows how to stay safe while using PayPal.
There’s a new PayPal phishing scam making the rounds, and it’s so convincing that even security-conscious users are getting caught in it. Unlike typical scams riddled with typos and fake domains, this one uses PayPal’s own email system to send you an alert that looks 100% real.
You might get a message like, ""You added a new address. This is just a quick confirmation that you added in your PayPal account.""
Except … you didn’t. And what if you don’t even have a PayPal account? Here’s what this scam entails, why it works and how to protect yourself.

PayPal app on a smartphone   (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
Most phishing scams try (and fail) to impersonate big companies. You’ve probably seen the classics: weird grammar, suspicious email addresses, Microsoft spelled with a ""k"". They’re laughably bad. But this scam flips the script because it uses PayPal against you. Here's how the scam operates:
Exploiting real features: Scammers abuse PayPal’s ""add address"" or ""money request"" tools. By entering your email, they can trigger real emails from PayPal’s real domain. And this works even if you don’t have a PayPal account.
Bypassing filters: Because these emails come directly from PayPal’s servers (service@paypal.com), they pass all security checks and appear legitimate in your inbox.
Lack of suspicion: Some versions contain no phishing links at all, just a scammer’s phone number, making them even harder to detect.
Panic bait: The message often claims a new address was added, or a large payment is being processed, getting your attention and provoking a quick reaction.
Follow-up attacks: After the initial email, scammers may later contact you pretending to be PayPal support. Some urge you to click a link to ""secure your account"", which leads to a fake login page designed to steal your credentials. 
This scam has been reported by dozens of users on Reddit and cybersecurity forums. One Reddit user posted a detailed thread in r/Scams showing screenshots of phishing emails that look like they came straight from PayPal’s official address. 
Phishing email sent from service@paypal.com (Reddit)
In a newer and more sophisticated twist, scammers are removing links altogether. Instead, they include a phone number and ask you to call. Once you do, you’re connected with a fake PayPal representative who says they need to verify your identity. They then instruct you to download what appears to be a PayPal-branded support tool, but really it’s a customized remote access app hosted on a different server. And once it’s installed, it gives the scammer full access to your device.
Screenshot of a customized AnyDesk application featuring a PayPal logo  (Reddit)
This part is still a bit of a mystery. With typical PayPal invoice scams, content is tightly controlled, which means you normally can’t change the email structure or messaging. However, these new emails suggest that scammers may be exploiting internal features, like business tools or API fields, to sneak custom content into PayPal-generated alerts. It’s not just phishing, it’s weaponizing a legitimate system to create trust and evade detection.
This scam is especially effective and dangerous because the emails come directly from PayPal’s official servers, making it difficult to distinguish them from legitimate messages. Since the sender address and branding are authentic, recipients are more likely to trust the communication without suspicion.
The scammers also use urgent language that creates a sense of panic, such as warnings about unauthorized activity or large charges. This pressure encourages people to act quickly and often before fully considering whether the alert is genuine.
Additionally, the scam often involves follow-up contact through calls or texts from individuals posing as PayPal personnel, further exploiting the initial confusion and increasing the chances of victims giving up sensitive information.

HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE VENMO, ZELLE, AND CASH APP SCAM THAT CAN WIPE OUT YOUR SAVINGS IN SECONDS
Even if you’re vigilant, you can still be targeted. Here’s how to stay safe:
1. Don’t click links in suspicious emails, even if they look real, and use strong antivirus software. If you receive a PayPal alert you didn’t expect, go to PayPal by typing paypal.com into your browser or using the official app. Never click links or dial phone numbers provided in the email.
The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.
2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Adding 2FA to your PayPal and email accounts gives you a second layer of defense even if your password gets compromised.
3. Use a password manager: Using a password manager is the best way to ensure every login you use has a unique, strong password. No repeats means no chain reaction if one site gets hacked. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.
4. Check your account manually: If you’re ever in doubt, just log into your PayPal account directly. Review recent activity and see if anything looks off. There is no need to rely on alerts alone.
5. Report the scam: Forward suspicious PayPal messages to phishing@paypal.com. You can also report phishing attempts to the FTC. 
6. Use a personal data removal service: Since phishing scams like the recent PayPal scam often target personal information that scammers gather from data brokers and people search sites, using a reputable data removal service can help reduce your exposure. Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 
Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.
This phishing scam is dangerous because it uses real PayPal emails sent from service@paypal.com. Scammers exploit PayPal’s built-in features to send real notifications that look legitimate. What makes it especially sneaky is the absence of links, Instead, these emails include a phone number, making them more likely to pass through spam filters. When you call, you’re connected to a fake PayPal rep who pressures you into downloading a remote access tool disguised as support software. The safest move? Don’t click, don’t call. Just go straight to PayPal.com and check your account manually."

right,"political analyst Gianno Caldwell discusses his new book, ""The Day My Brother was Murdered: My Journey Through America's Violent Crime Crisis.""
Chicago is bracing for another violent 4th of July weekend as  political analyst Gianno Caldwell continues to fight for answers in his brother's 2022 murder in the Windy City.
More than 100 people were shot over the holiday weekend last year, 19 of whom were killed, following a years-long trend of violent crime that threatens the city on Independence Day. 
The issue of violent crime in Chicago hits close to home for Caldwell, whose 18-year-old brother, Christian Beamon, was one of two people killed and two others injured in a shooting on Chicago's South Side on June 24, 2022, in an attack that was not intended for him, according to the Chicago Police Department (CPD).
""When tragedy hit, I had no idea that that door would be knocked on — never wanted that door to be knocked on — but because it was, and because I happen to be in a place where I have access to contacts people don't normally have, certainly, this has [received] a lot of attention in the press,"" Cadlwell told  Digital of his brother's unsolved murder.

Caldwell, who published a book this week titled ""The Day My Brother was Murdered: My Journey Through America's Violent Crime Crisis,"" told  Digital that he felt called to write a book about his experience trying to solve his brother's murder after going three years without answers. 
President Donald Trump on Saturday posted about Caldwell's book on Truth Social, writing, ""It is a tragic story, and yet one in which so much can be learned about violent crime in America, and how to stop it.""
""Giann[o] and his family have been through a lot! GET THIS BOOK NOW!"" the president wrote.
CPD told  Digital that its investigation into Beamon's murder is ongoing, and no one is currently in custody in connection with the fatal shooting.

""I realized just how much help was needed … after experiencing this tragedy in my own family. I didn't know the great difficulties I would experience days after my brother's tragic murder. He was an innocent kid, never accused of doing anything,"" Caldwell said. ""The police have continuously mentioned that he wasn't a target. And there's so many families who have [similar] experiences, as well.""
The book also details the murders of other innocent Americans killed in violent crimes across the country on the same day of Beamon's murder and features commentary from  host Sean Hannity, ""America's Most Wanted"" host John Walsh and Dr. Drew Pinsky.
""Enough is enough.""

""On June 24, 2022, there were 150 people murdered on that very day across the country,"" Caldwell explained. ""So many people have lost potential in their own families, and, unfortunately, that potential lies in graveyards in their cities. Enough is enough. That's why it was time to write this book.""
While awaiting answers from authorities, Caldwell has turned his grief into action. He has offered a $250,000 reward for any information leading to the arrest of everyone involved in Beamon's murder, and he also founded the Caldwell Institute for Public Safety, a nonprofit ""working to create a more secure America through crime prevention, public safety initiatives, and victim support.""
Gianno Caldwell appears in a still image taken from the video announcing his new Caldwell Institute for Public Safety. His brother's unsolved murder in Chicago prompted him to launch the nonprofit, he said. (Caldwell Institute for Public Safety)
""We know that there is a crime crisis, but there are solutions to it in cities that have worked. Miami is an example, which has the lowest homicide rate since the 1950s. . . . So, there are ways to get it done,"" Caldwell said. ""There just has to be a focus, and it has to [be] for places like Chicago, which has had a violent crime problem historically. They just need brave leadership. People are willing to go in, not just for the sake of being re-elected or for making money or some kind of fame, but for the people.""
Caldwell said he is interested in pursuing a mayoral run to help bring policies to Chicago that would prevent violent tragedies like the one that took his brother's life.

""Enforce the laws that are on the books. In some cases, enhance the laws. Don't create laws like the SAFE-T Act in Illinois, which allow[s] for people who are accused of murder to have ankle monitor bracelets,"" Caldwell said. ""It is going to take, again, brave elected officials who are willing to stand the call, not be concerned about their poll numbers or be concerned about being re-elected. These are individuals who are there for the people, not for themselves.""
The Illinois Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today (SAFE-T) Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2023, overhauled Illinois' justice system with provisions that granted more freedoms to defendants and reduced certain felonies to misdemeanors.

And those are what I think many Democrats on the left are not … willing to do. They're not willing to stand up and be brave and say, no, enough is enough. We gotta be tough,"" the Fox analyst said.
The June 24, 2022, shooting that killed Beamon on the 11400 block of South Vincennes Avenue also left an 18-year-old woman dead, a 31-year-old man in critical condition and a 25-year-old woman in ""fair"" condition with a gunshot wound to the leg, according to CPD.
An unidentified male offender entered a black sedan and fled the scene eastbound after the shooting, CPD said.

Chicago reached a 25-year high in homicides in 2021, when it recorded 804 killings. Since then, that number has steadily fallen to 695 homicides in 2022, 617 homicides in 2023, and 573 homicides in 2024. Last year marked the first time in five years since the Windy City recorded a homicide total under 600.

Republican senators told  Digital that after receiving a fuller intelligence report on airstrikes authorized by President Donald Trump against Iran’s nuclear facilities that they believe the initial leaked reports underestimating the damage were inaccurate and politically motivated.
""I think the leaked intelligence report was not accurate, and given the 14 bunker-buster bombs that were dropped on the Iranian nuclear weapons facility, I think that the clear evidence is the damage was overwhelming,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.
In response to why so many media outlets ran with the leaked story, Cruz told  Digital that ""clearly there was a political agenda at play.""
Earlier this week, CNN, citing people familiar with the assessment, reported that the early consensus within the Defense Intelligence Agency is that the strikes on Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan didn’t destroy key components of Iran’s nuclear program nor destroy its stockpile of highly enriched uranium.

The outlet also reported that the strike likely only set back Iran’s nuclear program by several months, not years, as touted by the Trump administration. 
Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth railed against the ""fake news"" media during a NATO summit press conference for casting doubt that the U.S. strikes on Iran obliterated the country's nuclear program. 
""A statement came in from the Atomic Energy Commission of Israel,"" Trump said during a Wednesday press conference from The Hague as he wrapped up his NATO summit trip in the Netherlands. ""They're very serious people, as you know."" 
""'The devastating U.S. strike on Fordow destroyed the site's critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility totally inoperable,'"" Trump read from the letter. ""'It was devastated. We assessed that the American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities had set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons for many years to come. This achievement can continue indefinitely if Iran does not get access to nuclear material.'"" 
HEGSETH TEARS INTO REPORTERS, ALLEGING THEY 'CHEER AGAINST TRUMP' AND IRAN STRIKES
Trump said on Saturday that the United States had completed a ""very successful"" strike against Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, saying that Iran’s nuclear enrichment installations have been ""obliterated.""  ()
Senators received a classified intelligence briefing on the strikes from top national security officials on Thursday.
Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told  Digital that widespread reporting on the leaked report was to ""try to undermine Trump, of course.""
""Listen, we walked through this in the briefing, without getting into things I shouldn't talk about. Basically, that is not an accurate picture, and it didn't purport to be,"" said Hawley. ""What they were quoting was actually not a full intelligence report; it was more akin to an after-action, early assessment guess. So, without saying more, basically it was very misrepresented.""
""And the thing is,"" he went on, ""any reporter who covers the Pentagon and covers national security, they would know that. So, I have to say, kind of bad faith, I think, by our reporter friends in the liberal media who are clearly just trying to undermine the president.""
TRUMP ACCUSES AYATOLLAH OF 'LIE' ON IRAN STRIKE: 'HIS COUNTRY WAS DECIMATED'

At least one Democratic senator, meanwhile, was also pleased with what was said during the briefing.
""Most of my questions were answered. I think it was a good briefing,"" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. ""I think Iran should not have a nuclear weapon. Hopefully, this has set back that program dramatically. And ultimately, we will see them go to the negotiating table, because that's the real long-term solution.""
While many Democrats have called the strikes an unconstitutional move by the president, Shaheen said, ""it was a limited, contained strike"" and ""I think if it dramatically set back Iran's nuclear program – initial reports are that it has – that’s a good thing.""
Other Democratic senators, however, were still not so mollified by the briefing.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told  Digital that the briefing ""has not changed"" his prior assessment that the strikes were a ""clear violation of our Constitution"" and that ""Trump is yet again betraying Americans by embroiling the United States directly in this conflict.""

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told  Digital that the briefing ""didn't change my view, but I think I'd rather just leave it there, because it's all classified.""
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., was more vague on whether his opinion had been changed.
""I can't tell you what I learned in a classified briefing. I can tell you that it was destructive,"" said Coons. ""We do not yet have a full and complete picture of exactly what capabilities were degraded or destroyed and what additional risks we may face or what decisions the Iranian regime may make."""
right,"A visibly frustrated President Donald Trump said he is ""not happy"" with Israel for threatening the fragile ceasefire with Iran, as he said both countries ""don't know what the f*** they're doing.""
What is it about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin ""Bibi"" Netanyahu that drives American presidents to profanity? As Iran and Israel were still exchanging salvos after President Donald Trump had declared a ceasefire, Trump complained that these two countries ""had been fighting for so long they don't know what the f--- they are doing."" Trump’s anger came through, and the ceasefire is holding — for now. While Trump is the latest president to send profanity in Netanyahu’s direction, he is far from the only one. In fact, presidents have been cursing at Netanyahu for three decades. 
In the 1990s, Netanyahu and President Bill Clinton had a contentious relationship. In two separate elections, 1996 and 1999, Clinton sent political aides to try and defeat Netanyahu. He succeeded the second time. In the interim, though, they had to work together, and on one visit to the White House, Clinton was annoyed with how Netanyahu comported himself at a joint press conference. Afterward, Clinton reportedly fumed to his aides, ""who’s the f---ing leader of the free world?,"" suggesting that Netanyahu had overstepped his boundaries.  
Due in no small part to Clinton’s efforts, Netanyahu was out of office during President George W. Bush’s years, but cussing came back with Netanyahu’s return during President Barack Obama’s time in office. Netanyahu and Obama really disliked each other, and had a number of unpleasant run-ins, including one incident where Obama left Netanyahu and his team to cool their heels in the White House while Obama went to have dinner at the residence.   
‘GUTFELD!’: TRUMP DROPS AN F BOMB
Then, as now, the Iranian nuclear program and the matter of the Palestinians were matters of intense debate. Obama and company felt that Netanyahu was too cowardly on both issues. A senior Obama official, who may have been Obama himself, told The Atlantic that Netanyahu was ""a chickensh***."" The remark sparked outrage, especially since Netanyahu had been a decorated soldier in the Israeli special forces. Netanyahu pushed back on the comment, saying in a statement that ""The attack on me comes because I defend the State of Israel and despite all the attacks, I will continue to defend our country and the citizens of Israel.""

Trump followed Obama and, by all accounts, they had a far better relationship, punctuated by important milestones such as the moving of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and the signing of the Abraham Accords peace deals between Israel and four Arab countries. But Bibi also irked Trump by calling President Joe Biden to congratulate him for his 2020 election victory. This move managed to anger both Biden, who felt that Netanyahu had waited too long to make the call, and Trump, who felt that Netanyahu had betrayed him by calling at all. Trump signaled afterward that he was done with Netanyahu, saying starkly, ""f--- him."" 
Trump has three more years in office, but it will be hard for him to break the cursing at Netanyahu record set by Biden. Multiple reports have Biden launching streams of profane invective at Netanyahu, including calling Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas ""two of the biggest f---ing a--sholes in the world"" ; saying that Netanyahu was ""a f---ing liar,"" and adding, for good measure, that ""Eighteen out of 19 people who work for him are f---ing liars.""; and barking, ""That son of a bitch, Bibi Netanyahu, he’s a bad guy. He’s a bad f---ing guy!""
BILL CLINTON URGES TRUMP TO 'DEFUSE' ISRAEL-IRAN CRISIS  
Biden also was not above cursing at Netanyahu directly. When Israel killed Hezbollah’s Fuad Shukur, a fiend who helped kill 241 U.S. Marines in 1983, Biden should have praised Bibi for bringing Shukur to justice. Instead, he screamed at Netanyahu over the phone, ""Bibi, what the f---?""

With Trump now back in office, the two men have mostly cooperated, with Trump helping to release some of the Israeli hostages from Hamas’ Gaza dungeons and striking the Iranian nuclear program, which elated Netanyahu. Yet the ""they don't know what the f--- they are doing"" incident shows that Netanyahu has the capacity to drive even friendly U.S. presidents to profanity. The question is why. One reason is that Netanyahu, unlike American presidents, lives in a dangerous neighborhood and faces constant existential threats. While some world leaders might acquiesce in a disagreement with the American president, Bibi is more likely to push back.  
A second reason lies in the way Netanyahu pushes back. His method, which he absorbed from his father’s mentor, the Zionist leader Zev Jabotinsky, is to reach over the heads of the presidents and directly to the American people. As the record of profanity sent in his direction suggests, this method tends to annoy presidents. It also appears to have led to a grievous and welcome blow to the Iranian nuclear program."
right,"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., tells 'The Brian Lehrer Show' on WNYC that New York mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani should denounce the anti-Israel phrase.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., called on New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani to denounce the phrase ""globalize the Intifada"" during a heated exchange with WNYC radio host Brian Lehrer on Thursday.
Gillibrand urged Mamdani to unequivocally denounce the phrase — which she argues is received by the public as a call to ""slaughter the Jews"" — after a caller accused the candidate of glorifying Hamas and the violent attacks associated with the intifada terrorism campaign launched against Israel in the 1990s.
""The caller is exactly the New York constituents that I've spoken to that are alarmed. They are alarmed by past public statements. They are alarmed by past positions, particularly references to global jihad,"" she said. ""This is a very serious issue because people that glorify the slaughter of Jews create fear in our communities. The global intifada is a statement that means destroy Israel and kill all the Jews.""

The New York senator then called on Mamdani to assure all New Yorkers that ""he will protect all Jews and protect houses of worship and protect funding for not-for-profits that meet the needs of these communities.""
Lehrer pushed back on her insinuation that Mamdani had called for a ""global intifada,"" asking if she doubted his prior statements committing to protecting Jewish people in New York City.
""One of the issues I did talk to him about yesterday was exactly this issue, and he has agreed to work with me on this and to protect all residents,"" Gillibrand replied.
After their conversation about Mamdani was briefly derailed by another caller's question, Lehrer jumped right back into their discussion once the Senator finished her response.

""On Mamdani, I just feel compelled to say we can find no evidence that he has supported Hamas or has supported violent jihad, as that caller was asserting. Can you?"" he questioned.
Lehrer stated of Mamdani: ""He was never out there saying ‘globalize the intifada.’ He was asked about others who used it."" 
Gillibrand asserted that while she doesn't have ""all the data and information"" in front of her, she did recall Mamdani referencing ""global intifada,"" and noted that she had requested an in-person meeting with the mayoral hopeful to discuss these issues.
The radio host pushed back on the senator once again, claiming that Mamdani clarified to him on his show on Monday that calls for a global intifada ""are not calls for violence because intifada is a much broader term involving all kinds of uprisings and resistance and things like that.""
Lehrer argued that there is no evidence that Mamdani ever supported Hamas or ""violent jihad."" (Photo by Sylvain Gaboury/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)
""Brian, I didn't hear your exchange with him, but if I was speaking to him directly, I would simply say that is not how the words are received,"" she countered. ""It doesn't matter what meaning you have in your brain. It is not how the word is received. When you use a word like intifada — to many Jewish Americans and Jewish New Yorkers, that means you are permissive of violence against Jews.""
The two continued their back and forth before Gillibrand left listeners with one final message for Mamdani.
""If you talk to any group, you talk to our LGBTQ community, you talk to our Black community, you talk to our Hispanic community, there are words and there are imagery and there are things that are said that they will hear it and feel it as a dagger to their throat. If you want to be a leader, you have to recognize how these things are felt and received,"" she contended.
""Saying there should be no word police is irresponsible, because, as a leader, you have to protect everyone. Period,"" Gillibrand added.
 Digital reached out to representatives of Mamdani for comment, but did not immediately hear back."
right,"The new president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that there is “overwhelming support” among members to protect the female category, in what appears to be a shocking turnaround from the organization’s previous unabashed embrace of gender ideology.

Kirsty Coventry addressed the topic of transgender-identifying athletes in women’s sports at her first official news conference since becoming president of the IOC,  reported.

“We understand that there’ll be differences depending on the sport… but it was very clear from the members that we have to protect the female category, first and foremost to ensure fairness,” Coventry said.

“But we need to do that with a scientific approach and the inclusion of the international federations who have already done a lot of work in this area.”

Coventry said there is “unanimous support” for agreeing to amend the organization’s transgender athletes policy; she said the IOC may follow in the footsteps of the World Athletics policy, which restricts transgender-identifying males from competing in women’s sports if they have gone through puberty.

“It was very clear from the membership the discussion around this has to be done with medical and scientific research at the core, so we are looking at the facts and the nuances and the inclusion of the international federations that have done so much of this work… having a seat at the table and sharing with us because every sport is different,” she said.

“But it was pretty much unanimously felt that the IOC should take a leading role in bringing everyone together to try and find a broad consensus,” she added.

Coventry said any new policy most likely would not include changing the results of past competitions that allowed transgender-identifying males. In the 2024 Paris Olympics, two boxers notably won gold in women’s competitions, even though they failed gender-eligibility tests for international competitions.

“We’re not going to be doing anything retrospectively. We’re going to be looking forward. From the members [it] was, ‘What are we learning from the past, and how are we going to leverage that and move that forward to the future?’” Coventry said.

The announcement comes after the United Nations last year released a study finding that female athletes have lost out on nearly 900 medals because they have been beaten by transgender-identifying male athletes, according to the report.

The study, called “Violence against women and girls in sports,” found that more than 600 female athletes did not medal in more than 400 competitions in 29 different sports because they were beaten by transgender-identifying males.

“The replacement of the female sports category with a mixed-sex category has resulted in an increasing number of female athletes losing opportunities, including medals, when competing against males,” the report said."

right,"President Donald Trump is ""riding high"" this week after dual victories in the strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities and NATO agreeing to spend 5% on defense, according to Matthew Kroenig, VP at the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center.
President Donald Trump continued to brag about the success of the U.S. strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities and visited the Netherlands for the NATO summit this week. 
The U.S. launched strikes late Saturday targeting key Iranian nuclear facilities, which involved more than 125 U.S. aircraft, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine told reporters Sunday.
Following the strikes, Trump said in an address to the nation that the mission left the nuclear sites ""completely and totally obliterated."" But days later, a leaked report from the Defense Intelligence Agency, published by CNN and the New York Times, cast doubt on those claims, saying that the strikes had only set back Iran’s nuclear program by several months.
TRUMP WOULD STRIKE IRAN ‘WITHOUT QUESTION’ IF IT RESTARTS NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM 
Trump said Saturday that the United States completed a ""very successful"" strike against Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, adding that Iran’s nuclear enrichment installations have been ""obliterated."" ()
Meanwhile, the U.S., Israel and Iran's Foreign Ministry have all said the three nuclear sites that U.S. forces struck have encountered massive damage.
Still, Trump has said he won’t hesitate to launch additional strikes against Iran – should Tehran seek to beef up its nuclear program again. 
Here’s also what happened this week: 
Trump attended the NATO summit in the Netherlands on Tuesday and Wednesday, where he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian leader said in a post on X on Wednesday that the two ""covered all the truly important issues"" as the U.S. has sought to broker a peace deal to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

NATO allies – all but Spain – agreed Wednesday to boost defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035.
Trump has long advocated for NATO allies to ramp up defense spending to between 2% and 5% GDP – and has made it clear that European nations need to shoulder greater responsibility for the security of their continent.
Trump pressed lawmakers to get his sweeping tax and domestic policy bill to the finish line on Thursday, labeling the measure the ""single-most important piece of border legislation ever to cross the floor of Congress.""

Meanwhile, Republicans are scrambling to reform and pass the measure ahead of Trump’s July 4 deadline, following Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough’s determination Thursday that several Medicaid reforms in the sweeping tax passage did not follow Senate rules and must be removed."
right,"PARIS  – France has struggled to kick its smoking habit. A new public health decree published Saturday aims to change that.

In the coming days, smoking will be banned in all French parks and sports venues, at beaches and bus stops, in a perimeter around all schools, and anywhere children could gather in public.

In a country where smoking has for generations been glamorized in cinema and intertwined with the national image, government crackdowns on tobacco use have met resistance.

“In France, we still have this mindset of saying, this is a law that restricts freedom,” Philippe Bergerot, president of the French League Against Cancer, told the Associated Press.

The ban aims “to promote what we call denormalization. In people’s minds, smoking is normal,” he said. “We aren’t banning smoking; we are banning smoking in certain places where it could potentially affect people’s health and … young people.”

It’s been illegal to smoke in restaurants, bars and public buildings since a series of bans in 2007 and 2008. Ever-higher taxes mean a pack now costs upwards of 12 euros ($14).

Yet more than 30% of French adults still smoke cigarettes, most of them daily, one of the higher rates in Europe and globally. The Health Ministry is particularly concerned that tobacco remains popular among young people, citing public health statistics showing that 15% of 17-year-olds smoke. Black market cigarette trading is common.

More than 200 people in France die each day of tobacco-related illness, Health Minister Catherine Vautrin said in a statement Saturday. That adds up to some 75,000 deaths per year.

In a Paris park as the ban loomed, views were mixed.

Parisian Natacha Uzan welcomed the énd of smoking in restaurants. But she said: “Now outside, in parks, I find it becoming a bit repressive.”

The broader ban is a “good thing” for Anabelle Cermell, mother of a 3-month-old boy. “I tell myself, oh, it’s really not ideal for him, but there’s not much I can do about it, or I would have to … not take the bus, not go to parks.”

The government said last month that the new ban would take effect July 1. The official decree introducing the ban was published Saturday, and a health minister´s statement said that a government order specifying the perimeters set by the ban would be published in the coming days.

Electronic cigarettes are exempt from the new ban.

Other European countries have gone farther. Britain and Sweden have tightened smoking regulations in public spaces. Spain is extending its smoking ban to café and restaurant terraces, which are exempt from France´s new ban."

right,"USC freshman basketball phenom Alijah Arenas recently opened up about his terrifying experience surviving a fiery Tesla Cybertruck crash earlier this year. The crash in Elon Musk’s EV left Arenas in a medically-induced coma due to smoke inhalation.

The Los Angeles Times reports that USC’s top basketball recruit, Alijah Arenas, shared the harrowing details of his narrow escape from a burning Tesla Cybertruck after a crash in April. The five-star prospect from Chatsworth High was on his way home from an early morning workout when the incident occurred, forever changing his life.

Arenas recounted the moments leading up to the crash, describing how the Cybertruck, registered to his father, former NBA star Gilbert Arenas, began acting strangely. The car’s keypad flickered on and off, and the steering wheel became unresponsive. Despite his efforts to switch lanes and pull over, Arenas lost control of the vehicle, which careened into a fire hydrant and then a tree before bursting into flames.

Trapped inside the burning car, Arenas fought for his life as smoke filled the cabin and flames engulfed the passenger side dashboard. Arenas claims the Tesla app had locked him out, preventing him from using his digital key to escape. Panic set in as he struggled to open the door, eventually moving to the back seat to avoid the smoke and heat.

Drifting in and out of consciousness, Arenas did everything he could to stay alert and break free from the burning vehicle. He bit his lip, clenched his nails into his skin, and doused himself with water to cool his body down. Despite the Cybertruck’s supposedly “unbreakable” windows, Arenas relentlessly punched and kicked at the glass until he finally spotted a crack.

As sirens wailed in the distance, Arenas heard a thud outside the car window. He kicked at the driver’s-side window until it fell away, and hands began pulling him from the vehicle by his legs. Video footage obtained by TMZ shows Arenas lying face down in the street, surrounded by a few inches of water from the broken hydrant, as good Samaritans came to his rescue.

Arenas spent at least 10 minutes trapped in the burning car before being pulled to safety. He was rushed to a nearby hospital and placed in a medically induced coma due to extreme smoke inhalation. When he finally awoke, unable to speak, his first thoughts were of concern for others, wondering if his car had hit another vehicle or if anyone else had been hurt.

Remarkably, Arenas suffered no major long-term injuries and spent only six days in the hospital. In the weeks following the accident, he focused on regaining his strength, taking walks through his family’s neighborhood and being showered with support from neighbors. The family even welcomed the men who saved Arenas into their home to express their gratitude.

Now, as Arenas prepares to join USC for summer basketball practices, he stands on the sidelines, high-fiving teammates and calling out assignments. His unique perspective on life and the game of basketball has not gone unnoticed by USC coach Eric Musselman, who commended Arenas’ thought process and approach to his teammates.

Reflecting on the incident, Arenas takes full responsibility for what happened, refusing to place blame on the car’s manufacturer or anyone else. He remains convinced that he was spared to help others in the same way he was helped, stating, “It taught me a lot. I’m very lucky — and not even just to be here. Just in general, in life.”

right,"Microsoft Research Asia, an influential research institute based in Beijing and Shanghai, has continued to conduct AI research at high risk of abuse, including facial recognition, with sanctioned Chinese universities linked to the communist country’s military. Despite these ties Microsoft insists there are guardrails against such sensitive research at the institute.

Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) was originally founded in 1998 as the Microsoft China Research Institute. By 2016, a Chinese media outlet reported that it had trained nearly 5,000 interns, with hundreds going on to Chinese tech giants and prestigious universities. It now employs over 300 scientists and researchers at its offices in Shanghai and Beijing.

As Microsoft’s position in China has come under increased scrutiny and U.S.-China relations have soured, Microsoft has tried to distance itself from MSRA’s deep connections with the communist country’s surveillance empire.

Microsoft claimed in 2024 that there are restrictions at MSRA “on work related to quantum computing, facial recognition and synthetic media” and a prohibition on “hiring or working with students and researchers from universities affiliated with China’s military.”

However, industry watchdogs claim that since March 2024, MSRA researchers have published ten papers that cover facial recognition or synthetic media which were coauthored with researchers from either sanctioned Chinese universities, military-linked institutions, or both. This suggests the “restrictions” on MSRA research into facial recognition and synthetic media are not particularly extensive and that such research continues despite the risks.

China experts tell Breitbart News that nine of these ten papers included coauthors from one of three sanctioned Chinese universities, two of which — Beihang University and the Harbin Institute of Technology — are considered part of the “Seven Sons of National Defense.” While not officially tied to the People’s Liberation Army, this unofficial group of universities is known for their very close connections to it.

The three sanctioned universities MSRA researched collaborated with on papers include:

Beihang University, sanctioned by the US in March 2023 for its “contributions to China’s military modernization efforts.”

Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), sanctioned in 2020 “for acquiring and attempting to acquire U.S.-origin items in support of programs for the People’s Liberation Army,” particularly missile systems.

The University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), sanctioned in May 2024 for supporting the advancement of China’s quantum technology development and China’s nuclear program.

MSRA quietly stopped recruiting from the “Seven Sons” and other universities with strong government ties, according to a 2022 report by QbitAI, a Chinese tech media outlet. But the research has continued, as evidenced by MSRA’s continued output of papers.

One of the papers, “PersonMAE: Person Re-Identification Pre-Training With Masked AutoEncoders,” embodies the risks inherent in much of the research MSRA does. The paper focuses on person re-identification, a subfield of computer vision concerned with tracking individuals across different cameras and locations.

This technology has clear applications in mass surveillance. A 2022 paper published in the Chinese journal Scientia Sinica Informationis, which also featured an MSRA researcher as a coauthor, noted that “as a key link in intelligent video surveillance systems, [person ReID] plays an important role in maintaining social public order,” likely referring to China’s vast network of real-time public surveillance cameras.

MSRA’s collaboration with universities linked to the People’s Liberation Army is not new. In 2019, the Financial Times revealed that Microsoft had been working with a university run by the Chinese Ministry of Defense on AI research, including facial recognition.

These types of ties are consistent with Microsoft’s attempt to position itself as anti-China while still profiting off of the Chinese Communist Party. As Breitbart previously reported, after Trump’s election, Microsoft asked for government “partnership” to challenge Chinese AI, while previously having invested over a $1 billion in AI research in China. Microsoft also claimed to not allow China to use ChatGPT, but made it still available via its Azure service.

right,"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., tells 'The Brian Lehrer Show' on WNYC that New York mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani should denounce the anti-Israel phrase.
Liberals at the network news divisions don’t have an objective or nonpartisan vision when it comes to who in politics can be defined as extreme. When you're a liberal, Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders isn't extreme. He's not very far from you. He gets a wave and a smile. But from their place on the political spectrum, conservative Republicans are uniformly ""ultraconservative."" 
On the morning after Zohran Mamdani won the Democrat primary for mayor of New York, defeating the merely liberal Andrew Cuomo, the networks could not bear to define a socialist as being a political problem for Democrats. But they could describe him as charming. 
ABC’s Aaron Katersky proclaimed on ""Good Morning America"" the voters made a ""surprise choice to back a young, charismatic socialist who promises to make New York City more affordable, signaling they’re ready for a break from the past."" 
MAMDANI'S POLITICAL EARTHQUAKE ROCKS DEMOCRATS, DIVIDING PARTY ON PATH FORWARD
Reporter Rachel Scott did say Mamdani ran ""very far-left,"" but it sounded like a positive: ""For progressives, this is a good sign for them. They see this as their candidate that ran on a very far-left agenda that talked about affordability."" 
Candidate for New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani speaks during a press conference while campaigning outside a Subway station in New York City, U.S., April 1, 2025. (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid)
On ""CBS Mornings,"" reporter Jericka Duncan said Mamdani was ""a progressive Muslim American immigrant"" with ""social media savvy"" who rode ""a wave of anti-establishment sentiment to a shocking victory."" That’s one weasel word for an extremist: ""anti-establishment."" 
Co-host Vladimir Duthiers almost endorsed the winning Democrat: ""Meeting people where they are, listening to them and having solutions that they feel speaks to their futures is incredibly powerful."" 
CITY-RUN GROCERY STORES, DEFUNDING POLICE, SAFE INJECTION SITES: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT NYC'S NEXT POTENTIAL MAYOR
On NBC’s ""Today,"" reporter Emilie Ikeda defined this candidate as merely on the left side of Cuomo: ""Mamdani ran to the left of Cuomo, focusing on affordability and pushing populist ideas, including free public buses, rent freezes and city-owned grocery stores funded by higher taxes on the wealthy. Endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mamdani’s success signals a potential ideological and generation shift within the party."" 
An ideological shift to the extreme? They couldn’t say that. But they aired Mamdani denouncing ""Donald Trump’s fascism"" without any comment or correction. 
Only ABC’s Katersky vaguely mentioned Mamdani ""faced criticism over his anti-Israel rhetoric."" None noted he released a rap song called ""Salaam"" in which he praises the ""Holy Land Five,"" who were convicted of funneling millions of dollars to Hamas. 
DEM SOCIALIST'S NYC PRIMARY UPSET SIGNALS 'GENERATIONAL' SHIFT IN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, STRATEGISTS SAY
Mamdani hates Israel and set up his campus chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine at Bowdoin College in the 2010s and, as a state assemblyman, introduced a controversial bill to strip the nonprofit status of organizations with any links to Israeli settlements. His opponents will make this an issue, even if the networks can’t handle it. 
The ""PBS News Hour"" on Wednesday night turned for analysis to Errol Louis, who failed in several Democratic primary campaigns for the New York City council. Amna Nawaz, a Pakistani-American Muslim, brought up the dreaded right-wingers and their ugliness: ""Errol, we have also seen some pretty ugly attacks awakened in reaction to Mamdani's win. That includes attacks on his faith. He would be the city's first Muslim mayor if he's elected. And we have seen some Islamophobia like this one from the prominent MAGA voice Charlie Kirk. He wrote: ‘Twenty-four years ago, a group of Muslims killed 2,753 people on 9/11. Now a Muslim socialist is on pace to run New York City.’ What does all of this mean for the kind of campaign you could see ahead?"" Louis said, ""hatred and division don’t work.""  
On ""CBS Mornings,"" reporter Jericka Duncan said Mamdani was ""a progressive Muslim American immigrant"" with ""social media savvy"" who rode ""a wave of anti-establishment sentiment to a shocking victory."" That’s one weasel word for an extremist: ""anti-establishment."" 
PBS failed to call Mamdani ""far-left,"" but a new NewsBusters study by Bill D’Agostino described the PBS pattern. From January 21 through June 21, the taxpayer-funded network spoke of the ""far left"" just three times, and the ""far right"" 127 times — an absurd 42-to-one ratio. 
Could a Mayor Mamdani fail? The Chicago Tribune, which endorsed Joe Biden in 2020, recently ran an editorial titled, ""New Yorkers, take it from Chicago — we’ve seen this movie before, and the ending isn’t pretty."" The paper wrote: ""Most of Mamdani’s ideas are shared (at least in principle) by Mayor Brandon Johnson, and many of them are popular in blue cities. But experience has taught us here that far-left candidates do not make for effective or popular municipal executives in today’s stressful economy."" 
Just as the networks aren’t really interested in how Brandon Johnson is performing in Chicago, no one should expect them to be critical of Zohran Mamdani. Democrat mayors have run deep-blue cities into the ground for 50 years or more, and no one at these networks is going to hold them accountable, any more than Democrat voters do. They save that ""accountability"" talk for Republicans."
right,"Corey Feldman discusses his movie ""The Birthday,"" which wrapped in 2004.
""The Goonies"" star Corey Feldman is concerned that the rise of artificial intelligence could ruin the ""magic"" of Hollywood filmmaking.
In a new interview with  Digital, the entertainer talked about his decades of being part of the film industry and what he thinks of it today compared to how it was when he was starring in beloved 80s classics like ""Goonies,"" ""The Lost Boys"" and ""The Burbs.""
When asked if he believes modern Hollywood can still conjure up the same ""magic"" that led to the creation of these iconic films, he said he wasn’t so sure.
""Well, I share the opinion that there is a lot of the magic that's been lost because of A.I., because of CGI, because of, you know, these things kind of taking over from the good stories, the great characters that we draw, the great writing,"" Feldman said.
JAMIE KENNEDY DEFENDS ANTI-ISRAEL ACTRESS FROM CANCELLATION, SAYS STARRING IN PRO-LIFE FILM CHANGED HIM

The actor, who recently marked 50 years in the entertainment industry, said how important it is for people in Hollywood not to let technology get in the way of elements that make good, meaningful art.
""And I think that it's so important that we treasure those things, because we're coming into a time where A.I. is scheduled to take over all the creative ideas from people's minds right now,"" he said. ""People rely on it for songwriting, they rely on it for music, they rely on it for special effects, they rely on it for story writing. I mean all sorts of things.""
""They'll eventually probably try to replace us actors with A.I. people,"" he predicted. ""I don't think it will be long before all of that is tried.""
However, the ""Stand By Me"" star said he believes that an industry that’s so integrated with A.I. technology will fail to resonate with audiences. 
He added, ""But will it survive? Will it win? Will it have the same magic? No, it never can, because it's called the human experience and if we don't bring the human experience to the table, why would other humans relate with the project?""
Feldman's decades in entertainment began with him starring in commercials as a small child. The actor, who is also focused on his music career – including launching a world tour later this year – said his musical talent is what jump-started his acting career. 
""As a child, you know, I used to have to go on auditions, and you know, when you're three-and-a-half, four years old, you can't read, you can't read a script, you can't memorize, you know, it's impossible. So, the way my mom thought to get around that was to actually train me how to sing,"" he said.
""So I'd go on a commercial audition, I'd go, and I'd sing to them, and they'd go, ‘Oh, that kid's so cute because he can sing.’ And then I’d get the part. And that led to my first TV appearance,"" he continued. 
Feldman, who starred in 80s classic, ""The Goonies,"" said he's hopeful he'll be cast in the upcoming sequel that was recently greenlit by Warner Bros. (Photo by Warner Brothers/Getty Images)
Feldman’s music career has come full circle, with his new single, ""Characters,"" released on June 22. He explained the psychedelic-sounding track is ""actually both a tribute to The Beatles and a celebration of my 50th year in entertainment.""
He said, ""It talks about really the many characters that I've played through the years. Obviously I've played a lot of memorable characters that people hold dear and near in their hearts, and you know, I always want to acknowledge the fans in some way, and I thought, what better way than to give back to the fans by creating a song that represents those characters?""
When asked what he thinks about Hollywood today compared to how it was when he started half a century ago, he said it depends on your perspective. 
""Yeah, I think there's pros and cons. I mean, look, you can say ‘the good old days.’ And yes, they were, I mean let's face it, the eighties were easier, the eighties were simpler, you know? People played outside together and rode their bikes and went on adventures. And it was just a beautiful magical time. But, of course, that's because I was a child then.""
The actor added, ""I think it's every generation that feels that way. I think that's just progress and I think that's the schedule of time. We all age, we all get older, but we also look back fondly at our earlier memories. I mean, let's face it, my life was a nightmare. I had a very abusive childhood. I had predators all around me. I had all that stuff I was dealing with, both female and male. So yeah, for me, it was a very difficult time. And, and personally speaking, today is a much better day.""
During the interview, Feldman also weighed in on news that ""The Goonies"" would be getting a sequel with Steven Spielberg producing.
Variety reported in February that Warner Bros. hired Potsy Ponciroli to write the script for the sequel. Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger, Holly Bario, and Chris Columbus – who wrote the original film’s script – will produce for Amblin Entertainment.
Feldman remarked, ""And the big question is, we don't know what the script is, when it will be done, when it will ready, who's included, who’s involved. Nobody's gotten the script, nobody has gotten an offer, so that's all we know for now. This is the 40th anniversary, though, of that film, so it's pretty ironic that this year is both the 40th anniversary of ""Goonies"" and the 50th anniversary of my career. Pretty wild.""
When asked if he thinks he will be reprising his role as Clark ""Mouth"" Devereaux in the sequel, he said, ""I think that's the way it's moving. I can't tell you."" 
Mentioning how the original cast are excited about the possibility, he said, ""We would all love to see it happen and we would love to be a part of it. But at the same time, we don't want to do it if it's not right.""
Feldman noted they’re pretty hopeful about the movie being a winner, especially with Spielberg on board. 
""I can't imagine Steven Spielberg doing it wrong. As long as he's involved, I know it's going to be magical. But that said, we're reserving, you know, any other opinion until we see a script.""
The actor shared some insight as to why the long-awaited sequel got the green light, saying he heard it might have been a response to the box office success of ""Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,"" which saw the return of its original stars Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder.
Feldman said, ""Chris Columbus did say to me that he felt the reason why this was happening now, finally, after 40 years as opposed to any other time in history, was based really on the success of ‘Beetlejuice’ for Warner Brothers, because they had such a success with that chemistry, which of course was bringing the original cast back."""
right,"Tanner Mansell, a Florida diver, was pardoned by President Donald Trump after he was convicted of freeing 19 sharks. ( Digital) 
A Florida-based diver thought he was doing the right thing when he freed a group of sharks—but instead, it led to a felony charge and, years later, a presidential pardon from Donald Trump.
On May 28, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr. were two of the sixteen recipients of Trump’s full pardons after the pair were convicted in 2020 of theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction.
Mansell, 31, of Jupiter, Fla., reflected on the fateful day leading to his conviction and the eventual unexpected pardon from the White House.

In April 2020, Mansell and Moore took a group, which included the Kansas City police chief and a SWAT officer, and encountered a buoy connected to a longline over a dive site. A longline is a type of deep-sea fishing gear with baited hooks to catch fish.
""It was just another ordinary day on the water,"" Mansell said. ""I had been running trips there for years and never had anything like this happen. I spotted something red in the distance thinking that, you know, maybe it was trash or a diver,"" he said. ""We saw that it was a buoy connected to a line, which is when we started calling law enforcement.""
Unaware that the longline belonged to a legally sanctioned National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shark research operation, Mansell and his team acted swiftly and cut the line. They released 19 sharks back into the ocean.
""I had no idea that this could be possible, you know, that you could have a permit to kill all these sharks,"" he said, noting that they had called the Florida Wildlife Commission (FWC) and NOAA's hotline before making the decision.
""In our mind, the entire time, we thought we were uncovering a crime rather than committing a crime,"" he said.

TRUMP PARDONS FORMER VIRGINIA SHERIFF CONVICTED OF TAKING $75K IN BRIBES
That belief quickly unraveled. Days later, Mansell said he received a call while out to dinner. 
""I just felt like my world came to a stop, my heart sank,"" he said. ""We called [law enforcement], we did everything that we could."" 
Despite their outreach to law enforcement, both divers were charged and convicted. While they avoided prison time, they were ordered to pay $3,343.72 in restitution, and the felony convictions prevented them from voting, owning firearms and traveling freely.
""The judge made a comment, and he commended us for our dedication to [the] environment,"" he said. ""He gave out what my lawyer said was probably the lowest sentence ever.""
Looking back, Mansell said he would have acted differently if he had known the law surrounding legal shark killings.
""Knowing what I know now, I absolutely would do things completely differently,"" he said. ""But if I didn’t know that there were permits for this, I don’t think that I would change anything… when you think you’re doing the right thing, you think you’re doing the right thing.""

""We were really surprised to get the pardon,"" he added. ""It wasn’t really discussed by my lawyers because it was so far down the line.""
A turning point came when the case went to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit and Judge Barbara Lagoa confirmed what Mansell believed throughout the legal process.
""She basically said … this should’ve never gone forward … she’s never come across a criminal that has called enforcement to report what they’re doing in real time,"" he said. 
Publicity from that opinion reached the libertarian Cato Institute, which published an article that eventually caught the attention of the White House. 
""The White House actually called our lawyers and said that they were looking into this and asked for more information,"" he said. ""That was really cool because our lawyer called us that the White House had it in front of them and were looking into it.""
Mansell learned of his pardon while boarding a plane, sharing he was left ""speechless"" from the news.
""I was getting a call from my lawyer and I answered, and he says, ‘Well, I’ve got good news for you. You just got a full presidential pardon.’ I was speechless. I couldn’t even say thank you. I just soaked it in.""
Mansell profusely thanked the White House and Trump for the pardon.
""All I can say is thank you. And I hope that, you know, maybe in the name of sharks, we can all take a look at what’s happening and say that [legal killings of sharks] shouldn’t be happening in Florida."" 
""I’m just so grateful. I have said thank you every step of the way. Words can’t explain it,"" he said. ""I know that the White House took a look at this and they decided it was worth it. And I got President Trump's signature.""
I SPENT 36 YEARS IN PRISON FOR A CRIME I DIDN’T DO. TRUMP’S EARLY PARDONS ARE THE RIGHT IDEA
Though the felony remains technically on record, Mansell said the practical implications of the pardon allow him to continue his work.
""The felony is fully forgiven so now I can vote, and I can own a firearm from what I understand,"" he said. ""And most importantly, it expedites getting travel visas for my work in conservation.""
Tanner Mansell shared that he was shocked when learning he was the recipient of a Presidential Pardon following his 2020 conviction. (Used with Permission via Tannerunderwater)
Asked how his view of government and justice had evolved, Mansell admitted, ""At first, I was like, I lost a lot of faith in it. I felt like it was just unfair, but now I'm thankful for the due process.""
""I've learned so much through this process,"" he said. ""I've always considered myself a law-abiding citizen, somebody that doesn't break the law and I respect law enforcement and commercial fisherman.""
""I got through into this political battle between commercial fisheries and shark diving tourism and it's tough, but now I'm on the other side,"" he said. ""At first I lost a lot of faith in the criminal justice system and now, a bit of that faith in the justice system is restored. There are a lot of checks and balances for a reason.""
Mansell remains committed to shark conservation and hopeful his case will raise awareness. 
""This case never should have been filed,"" Mansell's attorney, Ian Goldstein, said in a statement. ""These gentlemen made an honest mistake and were trying to save sharks from what they believed to be an illegal longline fishing setup. I can’t think of two individuals more deserving of a Presidential Pardon."""

There was no immediate comment from Moscow. According to Russia’s Defense Ministry, over 40 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight and on Saturday morning, over western Russia and Kremlin-occupied Crimea.

Long-range drone strikes have been a hallmark of the war, now in its fourth year. The race by both sides to develop increasingly sophisticated and deadlier drones has turned the war into a testing ground for new weaponry."
right,"The mass migration agenda imposed upon Britain by both Westminster establishment parties has significantly increased the cost of rent in England, according to analysis from a think tank.

A report from Onward, which studied the impact of migration on the housing market since the gates were first opened in 2001 by the left-wing Labour Party government of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, found that rents have increased by £132 per month on average in England as a direct result of immigration.

The analysis found that the impact of migration was even more pronounced in the capital city of London, which Onward claimed experienced a £216 per month increase since 2001. This, the think tank said, would have had a cumulative impact on the average renter in London of £20,975 in nominal terms since then.

The estimates were based on a model that accounted for other impacts on the rental market, such as income growth and cultural shifts.

“It operates on the assumption that, aside from net migration, all other factors have evolved identically across scenarios, enabling the model to calculate the rent differences between the actual data and counterfactual no net migration scenarios,” Onward said.

According to their model, immigration resulted in a ten per cent increase in rents since 2001, a six per cent increase since the “rapid rise in net migration” following 2014, and a 3.7 per cent increase following the 2021 “Boris Wave” of immigration after former PM Boris Johnson further liberalised immigration law following Brexit, despite having campaigned on lowering immigration.

The report found that “observed rent, or the actual growth in rent, has exceeded modelled counterfactuals assuming zero net migration from 2001, 2014, and 2021.”

The think tank acknowledged that the government has “consistently” failed to hit targets for houses built, further exacerbating the crisis.

However, this did not account for all of the recorded increases in rent, with demand being noticeably impacted by the estimated 5.8 million migrants who settled in England since 2001, the think tank claimed.

“The Government must confront the reality that high net migration, combined with a housing market that fails to deliver homes where people want to live, is worsening the housing shortage,” Onward said.

The report confirms longstanding criticisms from anti-mass migration campaigners, such as Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who has frequently linked the open borders agenda to the housing crisis, as well as strains on social services.

Onward’s findings were picked up by Tory Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick, who said on Friday that the report showed that “mass migration is making young people poorer.”

Jenrick was criticised by the Reform UK Chairman Zia Yusuf, who noted that much of the migration which drove up rents occurred under Conservative Party governments, including the most recent ‘Boris Wave’, which Onward claimed increased rents in £48.11 in England and £78.72 in London since 2021.

Yusuf alleged that Westminster insiders believe Jenrick’s public shift to the right on immigration has only been done to “hurt Reform” and that the so-called Conservatives would once again “go back to the centre, where you came from” if they return to power."

In April 2007, millions of Americans tuned in to ABC’s 20/20 as Barbara Walters introduced the world to psychiatry’s most devastating creation: the ""transgender child."" In a segment titled ""My Secret Self,"" Walters profiled three children—including a young Jazz Jennings—being raised as the opposite sex, explaining that they had been diagnosed with ""gender identity disorder.""
DETRANSITIONER PENS NEW BOOK ABOUT 'EMBRACING GOD'S DESIGN' AFTER LIVING AS A WOMAN FOR EIGHT YEARS
The episode marks the moment the Western world lost its grip on reality. A brand-new type of human being had been conjured into existence through the collision of psychiatry, endocrinology, and political activism. Yet while the concept defied everything known about childhood development and identity formation, large swathes of society—almost overnight—began believing the unbelievable: that a child could be born in the wrong body.
To understand how such a belief materialized, we must go back to an obscure corner of psychiatry in the 1960s, where a fringe group of doctors were studying what motivated men who believed they were women to seek hormones and surgeries. These researchers turned their attention to feminine boys, hoping to identify future transsexuals, and in the process they pathologized childhood gender nonconformity.

In the decades that followed, it became clear that what those pioneers mostly found were not ""transsexual children,"" but future homosexuals. However, by the time this was understood, it was too late. The seed had been planted—and the concept of the ""trans child"" was poised to take on a life of its own.
A pivotal moment arrived in 1980, when ""gender identity disorder of childhood"" was included in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III). After the diagnosis was made official, along came the medical ""solution"": puberty suppression, developed in the Netherlands during the 1990s.
While psychiatry conceived the idea, puberty blockers brought the transgender child to life. Before this intervention, it was impossible to raise a boy as a girl, or vice versa, with puberty looming on the horizon. But when the Dutch made puberty optional, they handed deeply misguided adults the means to sever gender-nonconforming children from the reality of their sexed bodies.

At the same time, a critical shift was also unfolding in the realm of trans activism. In the 1990s, trans activists decided to redefine transgender identities as innate and healthy, rather than rooted in mental disorder or paraphilic desire. This wasn’t grounded in new science; it was strategic rebranding. The old labels, while accurate, didn’t suit the nascent movement’s political goals.
The concept of the transgender child, freshly minted by medicine, fit perfectly into this new narrative. If being trans is innate, then transgender children must exist. And if transgender children exist, then trans identities must be natural—not pathological or deviant. It was a self-justifying loop—circular and compelling, but based on ideology, not evidence. 
In the decades that followed, ""trans kids"" were thrust onto the forefront of what was framed as a civil rights struggle. This devastating convergence of medical, political, and cultural forces ensured that countless children—rather than being given the freedom to grow, mature, and explore different identities—were locked into a lifetime of medicalization, embodying an identity imposed upon them before they were old enough to understand what was at stake.

Every story of a ""trans kid"" begins with tired stereotypes—little boys who like Barbies and princess gowns, or tomboys with short hair and a dislike of dresses. What separates a gender-nonconforming child from one diagnosed with gender dysphoria—now considered a ""trans child""—is not biology, but belief. Specifically, the child’s belief that they are the opposite sex. In our upside-down world, the child leads and the adults follow.
Yet, only a society in the grip of mass psychosis could treat children as wise oracles capable of divining an authentic gender soul while still young enough to believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy.
The tragic reality is: trans kids don’t exist. What does exist are gender-nonconforming children trying to make sense of themselves in a world that has abandoned reason in favor of ideology. These children—the majority of whom would grow up to be gay or lesbian—are being lied to during a crucial stage of identity development, and the consequences will haunt them for a lifetime.
Once the forces that collided to create the transgender child—psychiatric labeling, medical experimentation, and activist messaging—are understood, the dark irony of trans activism’s favorite slogan, Protect Trans Kids, becomes unmistakable.
In truth, children need protection from the very people who believe there is such a thing as a trans kid. The crowds marching in the streets waving pink, blue, and white flags in zealous solidarity may see themselves as righteous heroes, but they are not fighting to protect children. Instead, they are modern-day Pied Pipers, luring confused, vulnerable children away from safety and down the dangerous path first paved by psychiatry—one of false promises and irreversible harm.

right," contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss a breakthrough blood test to diagnose Alzheimer's and the rise in whooping cough cases seen in Hawaii. 
Experts believe they've identified a chemical compound in certain herbs that could help mitigate or prevent Alzheimer's disease — but before anyone makes a run for the spice rack, there are a few catches. 
In a study published in the journal Antioxidants earlier this year, researchers from the Scripps Research Institute identified a compound called carnosic acid, which is prevalent in rosemary and sage.
The compound could prove therapeutic for neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, the experts concluded.
COMMON HOUSEHOLD SPICE MAY INTERFERE WITH MEDICINES, STUDY SUGGESTS
Carnosic acid contains ""striking antioxidant [and] anti-inflammatory properties,"" the researchers wrote in the findings.
Scripps Research postdoctoral associate Piu Banerjee and board-certified neurologist Dr. Stuart Lipton, based in California, spoke with  Digital about the results.
Carnosic acid is found in rosemary and sage, which are popular kitchen staples. But there are cautions regarding these.  (iStock)
""In this study, we observed that administering this drug to mice that had advanced Alzheimer's-like disease significantly improved the number of neurons, as well as the number of synapses or connections between the brain cells,"" the team said.

The experts added, ""It also reduced inflammation that is caused by the current anti-amyloid antibody therapies. We also observed an improvement in the learning and memory behavior of the mice that received the drug.""
""From the results of our animal studies, we are cautiously optimistic for its success in the human clinical trials.""
Banerjee and Lipton also noted that carnosic acid is a ""prodrug,"" meaning it's inactive at first — but once it enters the body, it's activated by oxidative and inflammatory stress. 
""It specifically targets cells undergoing oxidative and inflammatory stress, without affecting the healthy, normal brain cells,"" Banerjee said. 
Using an acid found in rosemary, scientists created a new drug that reduced inflammation and improved brain cell connections in mice. Much more study needs to be done.  (iStock)
""This further makes it a safe option for therapeutics.""
The experts agreed that carnosic acid could potentially improve the inflammation that generally occurs in most aging brains.
There are cautions, however. 
Courtney Kloske, director of scientific engagement for the Chicago-based Alzheimer's Association, told  Digital that studies based on a mouse model of Alzheimer's can be helpful but are not conclusive.
There is insufficient clinical evidence to recommend rosemary and sage as a standard therapy.
""Models are important in helping us understand the basic biology of the disease, but we need human studies in representative populations for ideas to be fully validated,"" Kloske said.
""Therefore, while these are intriguing findings, more research is needed to understand the impacts and outcomes of these compounds on people living with, or at risk for, Alzheimer's.""
Cooking sage and rosemary won't provide the full anti-inflammatory effects, Banerjee and Lipton stressed.
Researchers are optimistic about future trials involving the new drug, believing it holds the potential to help those suffering from Alzheimer's disease. It's too soon to know, however.  (iStock)
""Critically, one cannot take sufficient herbs safely to produce the same effect as our new drug,"" Banerjee said.
The study, funded in part by the National Institutes of Health, did have some limitations, the researchers acknowledged.
Kloske advised that, at this point, ""no one should consume these herbs (or carnosic acid) to prevent or treat Alzheimer's or other cognitive impairment.""
Dr. Lee Murray, a neurologist in Jackson, Tennessee, echoed Kloske's concerns.
The scientists noted that cooking herbs won't necessarily give anyone the same benefit the drug does. (iStock)
""Before patients start incorporating rosemary and sage in every dish they eat, we need to remember these studies are pre-clinical,"" Murray told  Digital. 
""Currently, there is insufficient clinical evidence to recommend rosemary and sage as a standard therapy for Alzheimer's dementia.""

Murray, however, said the data ""is encouraging"" and opens the door to additional pathways for potential therapeutics.  
Banerjee said she hopes that ""our drug will start human clinical trials soon.""
She added, ""If it proves to be effective, it will be a great new drug for those suffering from Alzheimer's … From the results of our animal studies, we are cautiously optimistic for its success in human clinical trials.""

EXCLUSIVE – Yale University is facing a civil rights complaint due to its affiliation with a training program that restricts eligibility to non-White applicants.
The Equal Protection Project of the Legal Insurrection Foundation is filing a civil rights complaint against the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry (AAAP) and Yale School of Medicine ""for their administration and promotion"" of the REACH (Recognizing and Eliminating Disparities in AddictiThe program makes clear that applicants must be U.S. on through Culturally informed Healthcare) program.citizens and come from ""a racial/ethnic minoritized population,"" including ""Black, African, or African American, non-Caucasian Hispanic or Latinx, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.""
ILYA SHAPIRO: YES, TAKE DOWN HARVARD BUT TEAM TRUMP MUST DO IT THE RIGHT WAY
""Regardless of AAAP and Yale’s reasons for offering, promoting, and administering such a discriminatory fellowship, they are violating Title VI by doing so. It does not matter if the recipient of federal funding discriminates in order to advance a benign ‘intention’ or ‘motivation,’"" the complaint states.
REACH selects scholars for a year-long training session that aims to improve the care of racial and ethnic groups or ""underrepresented minorities"" with ""substance use disorders."" REACH scholars receive up to $104,000 and travel accommodations and have access to mentors. 
The fellowship eligibility criteria are discriminatory, the civil rights complaint argues. It argues further that since REACH is a health program, it violates section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and, because Yale and AAAP receive federal funds, they are subject to violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The Yale School of Medicine's website describes the REACH Program as ""a year-long training program designed to supplement the education of medical students, residents, fellows, and allied health professional trainees in ways to improve health outcomes for racial and ethnic underrepresented minority patients with substance use disorders.""
""The overall goal of the REACH training program is to: (1) increase the overall number of racial and ethnic underrepresented minority (URM) addiction specialists in the Addiction Psychiatry and Addiction Medicine workforce, and (2) increase the number of addiction specialists adequately trained to work with racial and ethnic URM patients with substance use disorders.""
Per the Yale Daily News, the Ivy League institution received nearly $900 million in federal grants and contracts in the 2024 fiscal year to fund research and financial aid.
Furthermore, most of Yale's federal funding came from the National Institutes of Health. The institution awarded a total of $643,720,557 in grants and contracts. Yale also received federal funding from the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Education, according to the Yale Daily News report.

""AAAP and Yale’s explicit race, ethnicity, and/or national origin program requirements are presumptively invalid, and since there is no compelling government justification for such invidious discrimination, their offering, promotion, and administration of these programs violates state and civil rights statutes and constitutional protection guarantees,"" the complaint states.
William A. Jacobson, founder of the Equal Protection Project, told  Digital that ""HHS provided a grant to AAAP, which partnered with Yale, to improve minority community health outcomes.""
""Such programming must never be permitted to cross the line into discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin. This line, unfortunately, appears to have been breached at AAAP and Yale by racially-restrictive eligibility criteria,"" he added.
Neither Yale nor the AAAP immediately responded to  Digital's request for comment.

Tatum's journey began as a college football player at the University of Arizona in Tuscon. However, he wasn't selected in the NFL draft, so he set his career sights elsewhere with his college degree, and explored various career opportunities in Tucson.
As Tatum was searching, he needed to find something to be able to provide for his family. He applied to join the police department and got a response.

""I didn't really like police officers from the community I grew up in,"" he said. ""I actually got arrested when I was eight years old for smoking marijuana in a vacant house. So my first experiences with police officers were of me going to jail and not necessarily experiencing police officers that were in the community to help.""

The Supreme Court had a banner day on Friday, the last decision day of the high court’s term, involving the justices reining in judicial power and serving up a victory for parents in the ongoing culture wars.
The high court's more controversial decisions were split along ideological lines. Liberal justices sometimes dissented with bitter rebukes, while the Trump administration celebrated what it viewed as landmark wins.
In the most high-profile case of the day, the Supreme Court ended the practice of judges issuing sweeping injunctions that cover the whole country and not just parties involved in a case.

The injunctions, often known as ""nationwide injunctions,"" have been a source of frustration for President Donald Trump as judges side with plaintiffs and block key parts of the president's agenda.
The case arose from several judges issuing injunctions that blocked Trump from carrying out his birthright citizenship plan. Rather than ask the Supreme Court to weigh in on the merits of the plan, which has been uniformly rejected in courts, Trump asked the high court to put a stop to the injunction practice.
The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision left open the possibility that judges and plaintiffs could use other avenues, such as class action lawsuits, to seek broad relief now that the high court has curtailed nationwide injunctions.
The Supreme Court decided 6-3 in Mahmoud v. Taylor that parents can opt their children out of a Maryland public school system's lessons when they contain themes about homosexuality and transgenderism if they feel the content conflicts with their religious beliefs.
Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, said the government ""burdens the religious exercise of parents when it requires them to submit their children to instruction that poses ‘a very real threat of undermining’ the religious beliefs and practices that the parents wish to instill.""

The president’s renewed embrace of the alliance follows years of friction, high-profile clashes with world leaders and controversial comments. Yet at this year’s summit, the tone was strikingly different.
Trump was welcomed by Dutch royals, praised by the NATO secretary-general – who even referred to him as ""daddy"" – and returned home lauding European allies for their patriotism. ""It’s not a rip-off, and we’re here to help them,"" Trump told reporters.
The transformation is as dramatic as it is unexpected.
Trump arrived at the NATO summit on a high note, following U.S. strikes that crippled Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. According to American and allied intelligence sources, the operation set back Tehran’s nuclear ambitions by several years.
The strike was widely seen as both a show of strength and a strategic warning – not just to Iran but to NATO adversaries like Russia and China.

Trump repeatedly called NATO ""obsolete,"" questioning its relevance and slamming allies for failing to pay their ""fair share.""
""It’s costing us too much money... We’re paying disproportionately. It’s too much,"" he said in March 2016.
He criticized NATO for lacking focus on terrorism, later taking credit when it created a chief intelligence post.
Trump softened his tone after becoming president. 
""We strongly support NATO,"" he said after visiting Central Command. ""We only ask that all members make their full and proper financial contribution.""
He continued to push for members to meet the 2% target by 2024.
Trump privately threatened to pull the U.S. from NATO unless allies increased spending.
""Now we are in World War III protecting a country that wasn’t paying its bills,"" he warned.
Despite the posturing, he called NATO a ""fine-tuned machine"" after extracting new spending commitments. He also accused Germany of being a ""captive of Russia"" over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
TRUMP HEADS TO NATO SUMMIT AS EUROPE AGREES TO HEED HIS DEFENSE SPENDING DEMANDS

The drama continued, this time with French President Emmanuel Macron calling NATO ""brain-dead."" 
""NATO serves a great purpose. I think that’s very insulting,"" Trump responded.
He also clashed with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau – calling him ""two-faced"" after Trudeau was caught mocking Trump on camera.
Trump ordered 12,000 U.S. troops out of Germany, citing Berlin’s defense shortfalls.
Trump ignited backlash after suggesting he’d let Russia ""do whatever the hell they want"" to NATO countries that failed to meet spending obligations.
The remark sparked urgent contingency talks among European leaders about the future of the alliance if the U.S. did not step up to its defense. 
The 2025 summit in The Hague unfolded with surprising calm. Trump’s hosts rolled out the red carpet. ""He's the man of the hour and the most important man in the world,"" Jeglinskas said.
Jeglinskas credited Trump’s blunt diplomacy – however unorthodox – for helping drive real reform ""He's brought in tectonic change to the alliance’s capabilities by... being himself,"" he added. ""It’s a gift for the alliance.""

Experts agree NATO’s recent revitalization stems from two major catalysts: Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and Trump’s relentless pressure on allies to boost defense.
""President Trump is riding high this week with two major foreign policy victories,"" said Matthew Kroenig, vice president at the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center, referencing NATO and the recent U.S. strikes on Iran’s nuclear program. ""It’s terrific. I hope he can keep it up.""
He added, ""Every president since Eisenhower has complained that NATO allies aren't doing their fair share.""
Now, Trump was the one who finally got them to listen, he said."

Jana Kramer has some regrets about her career choices, but as the sole provider for her children, the country star says she's done what she needed to do to take care of them.
""I mean there's definitely some things, some ads that I'm like, ‘Oh, I wish I could have gone back and maybe not done that ad,’ but you know, you learn and you go back and you go, ‘All right, I'm not gonna do that one again,’ you know? So sometimes when you gotta pay that child support check, it's just like, ‘Well, this is a good check money. I'm gonna take this,"" the country star told  Digital during a joint interview with Jessie James Decker about their first song collaboration, ""Do It in Heels.""
After Decker asked Kramer if she was talking about the ""vibrator"" commercial, they both cracked up and Decker told her, ""It’s OK, honestly it is what it is.""
Kramer continued, laughing, ""I'm not gonna do it again, like you know what I mean? Like I'm like, OK, I'm good now, like, you know? Like we're good, we're leveling up to a different [place], you know?""

She elaborated that she has to pay child support checks to ex-husband Mike Caussin, and ""I am a sole provider, where I have a lot of pressure on my shoulders to provide for my kids. And so I think that piece of it sometimes outweighs my moral compass.""
Kramer has primary custody of her two children with Caussin: Jolie, 9, and Jace, 6. She also shares son Roman, 1, with her current husband, Allan Russell. 
""There's nothing wrong with it. You're good,"" Decker interjected, before Kramer added, ""We could be on OnlyFans, but we're not, right? So, you know what I mean? There's a level where I don't want to go to.""

She said while she was writing the song, she knew she wanted another woman to collaborate on it. 
""And the only person I had in mind the entire time was Jessie, because I'm like, she's such a girl's girl,"" Kramer said. ""We’ve been friends for years.""
Kramer said she knew Decker ""would sound killer on this song, but it was one of those things where it's like, because we're friends, I almost didn't – I'm like, ‘I don't know if she would want to do that.’ It's like she's, you know, like what if she doesn't like the song? And then it's like that weird, awkward thing because we are friends, you know?""
She continued, ""Like if she hates it, and it's like, how does she let me down easy? And so, 'cause I'm still, you know, semi-insecure with my music and stuff.""
But she said she just decided to ask Decker anyway, ""And girl, you were like, ‘I love it. Let's do it.’ I'm, like, ‘Wait, really?'""

Decker said, ""I was like, I'm down. Let's do it. It was great, it was catchy. I loved everything about it, and I related to it. And I was, like, ‘I would love to do this with you.’""
Kramer said when she and Decker first became friends years ago, it felt like the industry wanted them to have a ""rivalry.""
""I instantly loved you,"" Decker said. ""I remember not knowing if you liked me in the beginning."" 
Kramer agreed that there’s a lot of competition between female country stars ""in general,"" and they both thought the other was more beautiful and talented, which she said led to a ""rival friendliness.""
Finally, they met up at a party, and Kramer asked her: ""’Do you not like me?’ And you're like, ‘No, I like you.’ I was, ‘Well, I like you, too.’""
""And that was it,"" they both agreed, adding that it felt like people around them had tried to promote a rivalry.

Decker said one of her favorite things about Kramer is how much she ""loves love, she is such a lovely girl.""
""What's happened to her has been very traumatic,"" Decker added of Kramer's ex-husband’s infidelity. ""And it shows you how strong of a person she is. She is so unbelievably strong, but it also shows you that she loves more than she wants to sit and be sad. She didn't give up. And because of that, she has found the man of her dreams. She is the happiest I have ever seen her.""
Kramer added that her past marriages and her current one have taught her what she's worth.

""Before I would let things go because of the family aspect,"" she admitted, but now… I found an incredibly respectful, loving man. And so it's always been my work along the way.""
She added that as long she continues to do the ""work and heal and grow, then, you know, and I have a respectful man by my side, it's going to be always light years different."" 
Going back to ""Do It in Heels,"" Decker said she wants people to ""feel good"" while listening to the song, like the way they did while recording it. 
She said, ""I think sometimes women can be so hard on themselves that ‘I should be doing this more, I should be mothering more, should be working more.’ But I think you've got to sit back and really listen to the message of this song. Which is ‘I'm doing it, and I'm doing it well, and doing it in heels.’""

right_lean,"The global economy’s concussion from five months of Donald Trump’s presidency is likely to feature when five of the world’s leading central bank chiefs discuss monetary policy in public on Tuesday.

From tariff-related trade ructions to oil-price gyrations caused by Middle East hostilities, the question of how to handle the fallout from White House decisions may loom large as Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell speaks on a panel with peers from the euro zone, Japan, South Korea and the UK.
The high-powered gathering at the European Central Bank’s annual retreat in Portugal will be the first time that its president, Christine Lagarde, has shared a stage for a public discussion with her US counterpart since the same event in 2024.






Back then, when they spoke alongside former Brazilian central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto, their discourse morphed into something resembling a group therapy session on the trials of setting interest rates at times of political stress — a premonition, in its own way, of the turbulence to come.
One year on, and at the halfway point of 2025, global policy is almost paralyzed by the need to navigate risks posed both to inflation and growth in the wake of Trump’s actions — a challenge highlighted by the Bank for International Settlements in a report on Sunday. 
Such a trade-off is faced by all the central bank chiefs who will speak on the panel in the hilltop resort of Sintra. Powell insisted on Tuesday that the Fed is in no rush to change rates, and earlier this month the Bank of England left borrowing costs on hold too. 
What  Economics Says:
“Quickening core inflation and slowing spending will keep the Fed uneasy, fueling debate about the appropriate number of rate cuts this year.”
—Stuart Paul, US & Canada economist. For full analysis, click here
The ECB itself, having just delivered a reduction, isn’t ready to do any more for now, and the Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep its benchmark unaltered at its July 31 meeting. The Bank of Korea is insisting on acting cautiously too. 
In a podcast before this week’s retreat, ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane emphasized the panel as the highlight of the whole gathering, whose theme of “Adapting to Change” seems something of an understatement.
“You do need to step back — rather than just talk about ‘what are we going to do in July or September?’ — to look at the underlying forces,” he said, before predicting that the central bank chiefs will deliver “a very lively session.”
Elsewhere, US jobs, Chinese business surveys and euro-zone inflation numbers will be among the highlights.
Click here for what happened last week, and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy.
US and Canada
Following fresh figures on Friday that showed American consumers are becoming somewhat fatigued, the US jobs report for June will offer clues about the strength of the labor market. Economists forecast employers added 113,000 jobs during the month, the fewest in four months yet still consistent with healthy labor demand.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics report is due Thursday, a day earlier than usual because of the Independence Day holiday. It’s also forecast to show the unemployment rate crept up to 4.3%. For a Federal Reserve awaiting more clarity on the potential inflationary impact from tariffs, any pronounced deterioration in the labor market would likely lead to more pressure on officials to lower interest rates.
So far, there have been only scattered signs of cracks in the job market, including the highest number of recurring claims for jobless benefits since late 2021. A Labor Department report on Tuesday is expected to show little change in May job openings from a month earlier.
Canadian goods trade data for May will probably show a continued sharp decline in US exports, with shipments to other countries rising but not offsetting the loss of access to the American market. The first payments of Canada’s digital services tax are due Monday, hitting major US tech firms with a 3% levy on their revenue from Canadian users above C$20 million.
Trump cited the tax as the reason for the US ending trade talks with Canada on Friday.
Asia
The week in Asia features a slew of PMI reports that will shed light on how regional economies are coping with elevated US tariffs. 
China gets a pair of PMI releases, with the official gauge Monday expected to show that manufacturing activity remained contractionary for a third straight month in June as persistent deflation on top of trade tensions weighed on activity. 
The next day sees the release of PMI figures for South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan and China’s Caixin gauge. 
The BOJ’s Tankan survey, also on Tuesday, is forecast to show that large companies plan to boost capital investment by 10% this fiscal year. 
Business sentiment among large manufacturers is expected to stay relatively upbeat, albeit at a lower level, while the gauge for non-manufacturers is seen staying close to the 34-year high set in the previous period. 
May trade reports are due during the week from Australia, Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka, while South Korea reports those figures for June. 
South Korea also publishes consumer price statistics for June that may keep the Bank of Korea on track for another rate cut. Indonesia June CPI is also due.
Industrial output figures from South Korea, India and Japan, and Japanese household spending data will bookend the week.
Europe, Middle East, Africa
Inflation numbers will draw attention in the euro zone. Data on Monday may show consumer-price growth picked up in Germany and Italy, though not enough to worry the ECB. For the region as a whole, economists anticipate an outcome of 2% the following day, exactly at the goal targeted by policymakers.
Other than price reports, clues on how the region’s manufacturing sector is faring amid Trump’s tariff squeeze will also emerge. German factory orders, along with French and Spanish industrial production, will be published on Friday.
Aside from its Sintra seminars, the ECB itself will offer plenty of other news. The results of its strategy review are due on Monday, followed by the institution’s own measure of inflation expectations the next day. On Thursday, an account of its June policy meeting will be released, revealing more on the decision to cut rates. 
Beyond Sintra, ECB officials will be out in force at another economic gathering later in the week in Aix-en-Provence, in southern France.
On Monday, the Swiss National Bank will reveal how much foreign-exchange intervention it carried out during the first quarter. Switzerland’s latest inflation numbers are scheduled for Thursday and may also draw interest from traders focused on the franc. Economists anticipate that consumer prices fell from a year earlier for a second month in June. 
In the UK, a full breakdown of gross domestic product for the first quarter will be published on Monday. Appearances by BOE Governor Andrew Bailey in Sintra and Aix-en-Provence will also be highlights. 
Away from Europe, South Africa’s Bureau for Economic Research will release its second-quarter inflation expectations survey on Wednesday. 
The report will be closely monitored by the central bank, which uses the two-year-ahead measure to inform its decisions. The bank aims to anchor expectations at the 4.5% midpoint of its target range, but is currently in discussions with the National Treasury to revise it lower.
In Turkey on Thursday, annual inflation is forecast to slow slightly to 35.2% in June from 35.4% the prior month. That may persuade the central bank to lower its main policy rate by at least 300 basis points to 43%.
It’s a quieter week than usual for monetary decisions, but some are still on the diary:
Latin America
Argentina will publish activity data for April on Monday, with the result in focus after first-quarter growth data showed that the economy expanded significantly slower than expected early in 2025.
Chile will follow with economic activity data for May on Tuesday, a reading that will follow weekend primary elections for center-left candidates hoping to succeed President Gabriel Boric in a race for the country’s top job later this year. 
The data also comes after Chile’s central bank kept its rate unchanged in mid-June, with policymakers saying that while domestic activity has exceeded expectations, they remain vigilant about an unpredictable global economy.
The monetary authority will publish the minutes to that decision on Thursday, with analysts looking for clearer signals about when policymakers may start cutting rates after signaling that more monetary easing is coming.
Later that day, Colombia’s central bank will publish minutes to its decision to hold rates steady on Friday. The Andean nation has been roiled in recent weeks by the government’s decision to suspend its fiscal rule, a move that along with a worsening debt burden led both S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Ratings to downgrade the nation’s credit last week."

Over the past week, XRP has shown a choppy price pattern, struggling to sustain momentum above key resistance zones and briefly falling below the $2 mark. Although the token surged past $2.20 earlier this week, selling pressure quickly returned, fueling fears that XRP may once again drop below the critical $2.00 threshold.

right_lean,"While much of Paris Fashion Week chased spectacle, Hermes chose a different path.




On Saturday, artistic director Veronique Nichanian unveiled a Summer 2026 men’s collection that spoke in a language of quiet strength, deep craft and calm luxury.
Models walked beneath soaring mirrors in sharply cut jackets, high-waisted woven leather trousers, and sleeveless tops _ pieces that fused house tradition with a modern, easy sensuality.
Nichanian’s colors were cool and exact: coffee, slate, taupe and beige, each one a lesson in subtlety. There was no shouting here, only precision.
What made the collection powerful was its restraint. Where others go wide, Hermes goes narrow _offering tailored silhouettes and a sense of order when the rest of fashion is busy making noise. Fine leather, featherlight silks, and bandanas with a whisper of fringe reminded the crowd that true luxury is about touch, not flash.






Nichanian’s playful touches — zigzag motifs, the wink of an unbuttoned shirt, a glint of silver hardware — kept things human, not stiff. It was a masterclass in how to make classic codes feel new, even radical, simply by refusing to chase trends.
In a season marked by designer shake-ups and economic jitters, Hermes stood alone: confident, focused, and unwilling to compromise. As Nichanian took her bow to cheers, she sent a clear message — at Hermes, luxury is about the pleasure of the wearer, not the applause of the crowd."

right_lean,"Japan on Sunday successfully launched a climate change monitoring satellite on its mainstay H-2A rocket, which made its final flight before it is replaced by a new flagship model designed to be more cost competitive in the global space market.
The H-2A rocket lifted off from the Tanegashima Space Center in southwestern Japan, carrying the GOSAT-GW satellite as part of Tokyo’s effort to mitigate climate change. The satellite was safely separated from the rocket and released into a planned orbit about 16 minutes later.
Scientists and space officials at the control room exchanged hugs and handshakes to celebrate the successful launch, which was delayed by several days due to a malfunctioning of the rocket’s electrical systems.

Keiji Suzuki, a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries official in charge of rocket launch operations, said he was more nervous than ever for the final mission of the rocket, which has been his career work. “I’ve spent my entire life at work not to drop H-2A rocket … All I can say is I’m so relieved.”
Sunday’s launch marked the 50th and final flight for the H-2A, which has served as Japan’s mainstay rocket to carry satellites and probes into space with a near-perfect record since its 2001 debut. After its retirement, it will be fully replaced by the H3, which is already in operation, as Japan’s new main flagship.
“It is a deeply emotional moment for all of us at JAXA as a developer,” Hiroshi Yamakawa, president of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, told a news conference.
The GOSAT-GW, or Global Observing SATellite for Greenhouse gases and Water cycle, is a third series in the mission to monitor carbon, methane and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Within one year, it will start distributing data such as sea surface temperature and precipitation with much higher resolution to users around the world, including the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, officials said.
The liquid-fuel H-2A rocket with two solid-fuel sub-rockets developed by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency has so far had 49 flights with a 98% success record, with only one failure in 2003. Mitsubishi Heavy has provided its launch operation since 2007.
H-2A successfully carried into space many satellites and probes, including Japan’s moon lander SLIM last year, and a popular Hayabusa2 spacecraft in 2014 to reach a distant asteroid, contributing to the country’s space programs.
The completion of H-2A lets him put more resources into further development of the H3, Suzuki said.
Japan sees a stable, commercially competitive space transport capability as key to its space program and national security, and has been developing two new flagship rockets as successors of the H-2A series — the larger H3 with Mitsubishi, and a much smaller Epsilon system with the aerospace unit of the heavy machinery maker IHI. It hopes to cater to diverse customer needs and improve its position in the growing satellite launch market.
The H3, is designed to carry larger payloads than the H-2A at about half its launch cost to be globally competitive, though officials say more cost reduction efforts are needed to achieve better price competitiveness in the global market.
The H3 has made four consecutive successful flights after a failed debut attempt in 2023, when the rocket had to be destroyed with its payload."
right_lean,"A group of Hudson’s Bay’s landlords don’t want to transfer about two dozen leases to British Columbia billionaire Ruby Liu, but the department store still has a chance to get its way.




The Bay, which filed for creditor protection in March, ran a process over the last several months to find buyers for leases belonging to it and Saks Canada. It agreed to sell up to 28 spaces to Liu.
Three leases were transferred to her without any hiccups because they’re in B.C. malls she owns, but another 25 are at properties held by a who’s who of Canadian commercial real estate firms.
Landlords for 23 of those sites oppose the transfer. Several have said in court they’ve been “very troubled” with their interactions with Liu and have had “no productive discussions, no meaningful disclosure.” Liu insists if the court hands her the leases, landlords will warm to her and her plan to open a new department store in their properties.






While the disagreement could serve as a roadblock to the Bay closing on its agreement with Liu, lawyers not involved in the case say the retailer has another route it can take to get a deal done.
That route lies in changes to the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act — Canada’s main insolvency law — made in 2009, said Jeff Lee, a Saskatoon-based partner at MLT Aikins LLP.
The changes laid out three criteria courts must consider when asked to assign leases to a new tenant.
The first is whether or not the sale has the support of the monitor, a court-appointed, independent third party which helps guide businesses through creditor protection.
In the Bay’s case, the monitor is Alvarez & Marsal. It has yet to reveal whether it supports the Liu deal and did not respond to requests for comment.
“Before any court application is brought forward, typically the company will test that out with them,” Lee said. “They’re not going to just sort of fly in blind and hope for the best.”
The second aspect for the court to mull is whether the proposed new tenant is suitable. Lee said that’s determined by looking at whether they can perform the duties of the tenant and pay rent.
Liu, who made her money in Chinese real estate, appears to have deep pockets but her experience comes from being a landlord rather than a tenant.
The final aspect the court will consider is whether a transfer of a lease to Liu is “appropriate.”
Lee said people should think of it as asking this question: “Is what’s proposed for this post-assignment lease relationship what people signed up for, or are they seeking to rewrite the lease or change the playing field so radically that it’s not appropriate?”
That’s where much of the tension could lie in the Bay case.
“You can’t go into CCAA as a tenant and then force your landlords to renegotiate their leases as a result,” said Peter Tolensky, a Vancouver-based partner at Lawson Lundell LLP.
The Canadian Press obtained a document last week that Liu’s lawyer sent landlords outlining her plans. It says she will take on the leases on an “as is, where is” basis but doesn’t mention the dining, entertainment, children’s and fitness experiences she’s told media she’d like to include in her department stores.
It’s unclear whether the leases allow for uses other than a Bay-like department store.
A court faced with a request to reassign leases will weigh this context and think about whether “the landlord’s world is being turned upside down by having this new tenant,” said Geoffrey Dabbs, a B.C.-based founding partner at Gehlen Dabbs Cash.
“The more it’s a minor inconvenience for the landlord, the more likely the judge will order it,” he said.
While the Bay hasn’t said whether it will seek an assignment, it’s likely because any company in creditor protection has a duty to show the court it’s doing its best to pay back companies and people it owes money to, Dabbs said. The Bay has a 26-page list of creditors, with some lenders owed more than $100 million each.
Liquidation sales and a deal to sell the Bay trademarks to Canadian Tire for $30 million have put a dent in what’s owed but selling leases to Liu would also help.
Anyone who made an offer for leases had to make a deposit of 10 per cent of their estimated purchase price. Court documents show Liu made a deposit of $9.4 million, in addition to $6 million for the three approved leases, which would equate to a purchase price of $100 million for 28 leases.
When a deal like this is reached, Dabbs said a company typically seeks landlord consent because commercial leases tend to have provisions stopping anyone from transferring a lease without a property owner agreeing.
It’s not uncommon for landlords to object because any leases that can’t be sold and aren’t assigned get turned back over to property owners who can choose how to fill them and under what terms.
“Remember, these are anchor leases, so they’re probably very favourable to the Bay or to the tenant in a lot of respects,” said Tolensky, alluding to the fact that anchor tenants are often given attractive rents or terms.
Thus, it’s more advantageous for landlords to get their properties back, said Monica Beffa, founder of an Oakville, Ont., law firm. If they do, they can then charge higher rents, develop them for entirely new uses such as residential units or break them up into smaller parcels that can be rented by a wide array of tenants.
If they don’t and a court assigns the leases to Liu, landlords will likely be watching her closely to ensure she doesn’t violate any terms of the agreement.
“The landlord may be cranky, if the tenant breaches, but put it this way, they don’t want to rely on that,” Dabbs said.
“If they don’t want this lease being assigned, they will fight it right up front.”"
right_lean,"President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs in April stirred fears that the era of US exceptionalism was over, and European and Asian money managers would cut back on buying US corporate debt. So far, it’s not happening, and foreign investors are buying more American debt than they have in months.


 — President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs in April stirred fears that the era of US exceptionalism was over, and European and Asian money managers would cut back on buying US corporate debt. So far, it’s not happening, and foreign investors are buying more American debt than they have in months.




Overseas investors bought about $45 billion of US corporate notes in April, the most in six months, according to the latest Treasury Department data analyzed this week by Citigroup Inc. strategists including Daniel Sorid and Mathew Jacob.
The robust demand underscores how powerful the status quo is. There are few other debt markets that are as deep as the US’s. There’s about $7.5 trillion of high-grade US corporate bonds outstanding, according to  index data, more than double the size of its euro-denominated counterpart.   






“The US corporate bond market plays too important of a role in global investment portfolios for the turmoil of April to make a significant dent in demand,” said Citigroup’s Sorid in an interview.
Even if investors do look to shift money out of the US, it will take time for them to find and buy the securities they need. There is extraordinary diversification by sector, quality and duration available in the US, Sorid said. On top of that, liquidity in the credit market has improved since the Federal Reserve stepped in as the lender of last resort at the height of the 2020 pandemic.    
That made credit an attractive option for investors that were looking to scale back from Treasuries, Sorid said. Foreign demand for US Treasuries declined sharply in April, with foreign holdings of long-term US government bonds decreasing by $111 billion on a valuation adjusted basis and their T-bill holdings falling by $10 billion, according to Citi. Mortgage bonds took a hit too.
Still, some overseas buyers pulled back in April. Canada was a net seller of $1.4 billion of US corporate notes in April, according to Treasury data analyzed by Citi.
And Europe is a plausible alternative for many investors, according to Amanda Lynam, head of macro credit research at BlackRock Inc. After many years of negative interest rates, European debt markets are finally seeing better yields and there’s a lot of optimism that government spending for areas including defense can help support growth over the medium to long term, said Lynam on UBS’s Market Moves podcast.
In addition, the European Central Bank still owns a decent portion of bonds that it bought during the pandemic, she said. That in some way forces investors to move down the quality spectrum because there’s just a lack of bonds available to buy.
“The marginal dollar has a higher chance of being allocated at home as opposed to in the US now that there’s a return of yield support in that market,” said Lynam, referring to the European market. She added that even if Europe is attractive at the margin, US exceptionalism isn’t generally fading among investors. 
That may change over time. Barings, the $442 billion asset manager, believes demand for European corporate debt will rise. 
“US exceptionalism is a little bit more questioned, investors are increasingly concerned about US economic policy,” Mike Best, a high-yield and senior loan portfolio manager at the firm, said on the  Intelligence Credit Edge podcast.
But talk of foreign investors losing interest in the US has been brewing for years, and little has come of it. The swift recovery across credit, equities and the rates markets since April underscores the resilience of the US economy, according to Jim Zelter, President of Apollo Global Management. 
“The market has moved on,” Zelter said on  TV this week.

right_lean,"A new version of a plan to sell vast tracts of public lands to help pay for President Donald Trump’s massive package of tax cuts has been added back into the Senate’s latest version of the package.


 — A new version of a plan to sell vast tracts of public lands to help pay for President Donald Trump’s massive package of tax cuts has been added back into the Senate’s latest version of the package.




The plan, which would mandate the sale of as much 1.2 million acres of Interior Department land for housing or “community development” across 11 western states, represents a blow to conservationists staunchly opposed to the measures. 
It could also complicate the path forward for the $4.2 trillion tax and spending package. The plan has been opposed by Western Republicans, who said earlier they have the votes to strike the measure from the bill.  
“I don’t support selling public lands,” Senator Steve Daines, a Montana Republican, said in an interview earlier this week. “I think it’s shortsighted.” 






Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican leading the land sales effort — which dovetails with a Trump administration plan to use federal land to address a housing crisis — has said the step is needed to address a nationwide shortage of millions of affordable homes. 
“Unlocking federal land for housing will develop millions of single-family homes, resulting in greater housing supply and making housing more affordable,” the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which Lee leads, said in a fact sheet on the proposal.
Lee was forced to narrow the plan, which initially mandated the sale of as much as 3 million acres in federal land, after the Senate’s rule keeper said it didn’t comply with budgetary rules. The new version doesn’t include sales of US Forest Service Land and limits sales to be located within 5 miles of a “population center.” 
The sponsors of the latest provision estimate it would raise $6 billion.   
“The proposal would still amount to the largest sale of U.S. public lands in modern history,” the non-profit Wilderness Society said in a statement. “It is likely to threaten access to popular hiking trails, ski slopes and other outdoor recreation areas along with important wildlife habitat and cultural sites.”"
right_lean,"Key tax incentives for US wind and solar projects would face a more aggressive phase-out in the Senate’s latest version of President Donald Trump’s spending package.


 — Key tax incentives for US wind and solar projects would face a more aggressive phase-out in the Senate’s latest version of President Donald Trump’s spending package. 




The tweak, which follows pushback by Trump on the Inflation Reduction Act credits, would sharply limit the number of solar and wind farms that qualify for incentives, appeasing opponents while risking the ire of moderate members who argued for a slower phase-out. 
Under the new version of the $4.2 trillion tax and spending package released late Friday, wind and solar projects would need to be up and running by the end of 2027 to receive a pair of lucrative incentives for clean energy production. 






The initial version released by the Senate’s tax-writing committee simply required projects to start construction by the end of 2025 to get the incentives’ full value.
“This is a huge problem for wind and solar developers, who thought they would have at least four years to finish projects that started in 2025,” said James Lucier, managing director at research group Capital Alpha Partners.
If it becomes law, the change could be a blow to companies such as NextEra Energy Inc., the biggest US developer of wind and solar projects, which has an inventory of projects that qualified as starting construction in 2025, Lucier said.
The legislation also adds a new tax on  wind and solar projects that don’t meet strict restrictions against the use of Chinese materials, as well as adds the production of coal used in steel making to an existing tax credit for clean energy technology such as wind turbines and solar panels. 
A residential energy credit that has benefitted solar-leasing companies such as Sunrun Inc., would expire at the end of 2025 in the current legislation. But it restores access to a separate investment tax credit until the end of 2027 that an earlier version of the bill removed, Charlotte Jenkins, a vice president at research firm Capstone LLC, said in an email. Still, the tweak wasn’t enough to stop the solar industry from slamming the bill.
“Any senator who votes for this bill is voting for higher energy prices, a weaker economy, and a less secure America,” the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement. “And they’ll have to answer for it when families open their utility bills, when workers lose their paychecks, and when voters head to the polls.“
The bill does include a longer phase-out of a tax credit for hydrogen production used by companies such as Plug Power Inc. While the initial version of the legislation ended the credit after this year, the new version allows it to remain until 2028. 
Other tweaks made in the new version of the bill includes a quicker end to a popular $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles. 
While the earlier proposal would have ended the incentive at the end of this year for most EV sales, the new version terminates the credit after September 30, 2025. Tax credits for the purchase of used and commercial electric vehicles would end at the same time.
The tweaks reflect House Republican resistance to the more generous timetables. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Thursday the House will need to reverse the Senate’s move to extend a slew of clean energy tax credits.
“We had a lot of back and forth over getting that language right to keep it tight,” Scalise said. Trump “is where we are, if not more aggressive, in getting rid of it,” he said.

 — Automaker Lotus said it has no plans to end production in the UK following an earlier report that it will shut its plant in the country. 




“We are actively exploring strategic options to enhance efficiency and ensure global competitiveness in the evolving market,” the company said in a statement. “Lotus Cars is continuing normal operations, and there are no plans to close the factory.”
The Financial Times reported on Friday that the company, which is controlled by Chinese carmaker Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd., planned to stop manufacturing at its Hethel site in the UK, which could endanger 1,300 jobs. Lotus said in a statement to the newspaper at the time that it paused production from mid-May to manage inventories amid supply chain issues related to US tariffs. 






Once renowned globally for producing brands such as Mini and Jaguar, the UK car industry has been in decline for years, with Brexit and high energy costs adding to its challenges. The closure of Lotus’s plant would have dealt yet another blow to the UK economy, following closures by other companies such as Honda and Ford.
On Saturday, the FT said UK government officials had reached out to Lotus and Geely executives and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds is expected to speak to the car company on Sunday. The government declined to comment to the newspaper.  
Lotus said it has invested significantly in its UK operations over the last six years and remains committed to the country. The UK is its largest commercial market, according to the statement."
right_lean,"France has struggled to kick its smoking habit. A new public health decree published Saturday aims to change that.




In the coming days, smoking will be banned in all French parks and sports venues, at beaches and bus stops, in a perimeter around all schools, and anywhere children could gather in public.
In a country where smoking has for generations been glamorized in cinema and intertwined with the national image, government crackdowns on tobacco use have met resistance.
“In France, we still have this mindset of saying, ‘this is a law that restricts freedom,”‘ Philippe Bergerot, president of the French League Against Cancer, told the Associated Press.






The ban aims “to promote what we call denormalization. In people’s minds, smoking is normal,” he said. “We aren’t banning smoking; we are banning smoking in certain places where it could potentially affect people’s health and … young people.”
It’s been illegal to smoke in restaurants, bars and public buildings since a series of bans in 2007 and 2008. Ever-higher taxes mean a pack now costs upwards of 12 euros ($14).
Yet more than 30% of French adults still smoke cigarettes, most of them daily, one of the higher rates in Europe and globally. The Health Ministry is particularly concerned that tobacco remains popular among young people, citing public health statistics showing that 15% of 17-year-olds smoke. Black market cigarette trading is common.
More than 200 people in France die each day of tobacco-related illness, Health Minister Catherine Vautrin said in a statement Saturday. That adds up to some 75,000 deaths per year.
In a Paris park as the ban loomed, views were mixed.
Parisian Natacha Uzan welcomed the end of smoking in restaurants. But she said: “Now outside, in parks, I find it becoming a bit repressive.”
The broader ban is a ”good thing” for Anabelle Cermell, mother of a 3-month-old boy. ”I tell myself, oh, it’s really not ideal for him, but there’s not much I can do about it, or I would have to … not take the bus, not go to parks.”
The government said last month that the new ban would take effect July 1. The official decree introducing the ban was published Saturday, and a health minister’s statement said that a government order specifying the perimeters set by the ban would be published in the coming days.
Electronic cigarettes are exempt from the new ban.
Other European countries have gone farther. Britain and Sweden have tightened smoking regulations in public spaces. Spain is extending its smoking ban to cafe and restaurant terraces, which are exempt from France’s new ban."
right_lean,"For today’s oil traders, headlines about bombs falling have increasingly become an opportunity to sell.


 — Traders watched with alarm as US jets bombed a major Middle Eastern oil producer. An initial surge in the price of crude turned into a rout as soon as they realized that oil flows would continue unaffected.




The year was 1991, and the US bombing campaign was against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. In just one night, prices collapsed by 30%.
Three decades later, oil traders are picking up the pieces from a 12-day rollercoaster ride that saw prices surging and tumbling in the most manic period of oil trading since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.
Once again, traders spent nights glued to their desks, joining conference calls in the early hours of the morning and relentlessly working government and military connections for intelligence to give them a trading edge. Just like in 1991, early spikes quickly turned into routs as traders focused on the reality of whether oil would keep flowing. And it did.






The past fortnight has provided stark evidence of the psychological shift that’s taken place in a market long haunted by memories of cataclysmic price moves driven by Middle Eastern conflict in the 1970s and 1980s. For today’s oil traders, headlines about bombs falling have increasingly become an opportunity to sell.  
“Markets today are lot more resilient to news — they go straight to the issue of whether there will be a supply disruption or not, against the backdrop of how much spare production capacity exists,” said Mike Muller, the former head of Vitol Group in Asia and former head of crude trading at Shell Plc.
Muller recalls, as a young trader on Shell’s oil futures desk, trading through the night of Jan. 16, 1991, only leaving his desk in the morning when his bosses ordered him to go home. Shell had decided to sell into any rally, and Muller sold cargo after cargo as the market surged then collapsed.
Today’s traders, much like those in 1991, have spent the past two weeks wrestling with the prospect of the type of supply disruption that only happens once in a generation: an interruption to the Strait of Hormuz chokepoint that ships about a fifth of the world’s oil. 
Traders on some desks in Geneva and London worked in shifts to ensure 24-hour coverage — though in reality many stayed awake anyway, scrolling social media feeds and joining emergency calls at 3 a.m. as rumors flew.
As traders tried to work out whether this time was different, they honed in on satellite images over Iran and Hormuz, where not only was there no disruption, but if anything oil flows looked higher. Off the coast of Iran each day, a steady flow of tankers were picking up the country’s barrels and sailing off into the ocean. While Tehran’s empty ships had scattered — likely for security reasons — Iran’s oil was flowing at a rate about 40% higher than the average for the rest of the year. 
Still, while traders today have a massive amount of digital information at their disposal, from real-time satellite images to second-by-second “crowd reporting” on social media, some of the world’s top physical oil traders emphasized how they’d spent the past two weeks hunting intel the more old-fashioned way: tapping connections in Washington, Israel and elsewhere for a sense of the war’s direction and Iran’s ability to respond. 
That insight helped harden convictions that the US would enter the fray, and that Iran wouldn’t shut down Hormuz, they said. 
One senior executive said he told staff to follow Donald Trump’s social media posts as a guide for what to do next. On June 16, the president posted on his Truth Social site: “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON.”
Options Explode
As the rapid pace of headlines meant trading crude futures suddenly got much riskier, money poured into the options space, where traders are able to take out insurance against a spike at a cheaper cost than trading futures.
There, markets were moving so fast that traders and brokers were constantly having to re-price deals or risk losing business as each fresh headline signaling escalation pushed volatility and the cost of buying such insurance higher, people involved in the market said. Record volumes of options changed hands, and the total amount traded over just seven working days was the equivalent normally seen in several months. 
“In times of geopolitical risk traders move to the options market rather than the futures market,” said Nicky Ferguson, head of analytics at Energy Aspects Ltd. “We haven’t seen much change in discretionary hedge fund futures positions over the last month, but their bullish options exposure exploded.”
Tellingly though, traders weren’t placing wagers on an astronomical rise in prices at the same pace they have in previous rallies. Even when hostilities between Iran and Israel cooled after attacks in October last year and some contracts had expired, there were still about 130,000 Brent $100 calls outstanding for the next six trading months. Right now those wagers are about 60% of the size they were back then.
While all of the oil market’s cogs were suddenly whirring, diesel flows were among those most threatened by any potential disruptions in Hormuz. Prices surged from $85 to $110 a barrel as traders who had been wagering on a global growth slowdown were forced to cover their positions, people involved in the market said.
Meanwhile, on Singapore’s physical oil-trading desks, where barrels from the Middle East are generally bought and sold for refiners in Asia, an uncanny quiet emerged. There, trading of spot cargoes virtually ground to a halt at what would normally be the busiest time of the month, as traders waited to see what happened next.
Weekend Drama
For derivatives traders, the conflict was punctuated by two weekends that created moments of drama and tough trading decisions. When markets reopened on June 16, prices spiked briefly before retreating as traders focused on the uninterrupted oil flows. 
A week later, the stakes were even higher after the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. Yet oil production and trade remained unaffected.
Some traders were glued to a newly launched weekend retail product, trying to parse whether it could accurately forecast Monday’s trading. Others confidently told clients prices were about to fall, while some described privately how they spent Sunday gearing up to sell at the open, but lost their conviction as Iran vowed revenge. Prices spiked as trading began.
Yet it wasn’t long before the market followed Muller’s cue from 1991: Sell, sell, sell.
Iran’s muted response to the US bombs sent prices plunging, and by the time crude opened on Tuesday morning it was more than $10 below the level it touched when trading began a day earlier. The oil market’s new mantra was clearer than ever: selling oil’s geopolitical spikes had worked again. 
The First Gulf War “set the bar for what we now refer to as supply risk premium,” said Muller, the veteran trader. “From that time onwards the trading community has been happy to place their bets on air defences prevailing.”"
right_lean,"Anyone who works Monday to Friday and is keen for a long weekend this Canada Day has likely had to do a bit of calendar juggling to cope with the ill-timed holiday.




The stat day falls on a Tuesday this year, forcing many to work an odd Monday squeezed between days off, unless they burn a vacation day to eliminate the wonky schedule.
Some startup companies say they’re calling Monday a wash and giving staff a paid day off in order to smooth out the mid-week quirk and create a long weekend.
It might not make sense on paper, said Klarify founder Moody Abdul, but he said he believes in prioritizing employee happiness.






“It’s that, ‘if I take care of you, you’ll take care of us’ kind of mentality,” Abdul said.
Connecting the Canada Day holiday to the preceding weekend is just one way to demonstrate worker appreciation, said Abdul, whose company provides AI-driven note-taking and administrative tools to therapists.
For those in Quebec, it’s the second holiday Tuesday in a row, after Saint-Jean Baptiste Day on June 24 forced many Fete nationale celebrants to grapple with their own odd workweek.
But with Canada Day following so close behind, it’s not uncommon for Quebecers to take the whole week off between the two holidays, much the way many treat the stretch between Christmas and New Year’s.
Of course not every employer can offer such accommodations, and full-time workers with less shift leeway will have to choose to take a vacation day or just make do with an odd schedule next week.
Ani Siddique, a research assistant at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, said he asked far in advance for Monday off in order to get ahead of colleagues with the same idea.
“I had to ask for it but I planned for things one or two months in advance,” he said.
Morad Affifi, who sat in a downtown park after a shift Friday, said the majority of his planned Canada Day festivities take place over the weekend but he, too, dipped into his vacation bank to avoid working Monday.
Suze Mason, co-founder of the digital health platform Sprout Family, said her five staff members have the Monday off and she didn’t expect the move to have much of an operational impact on her company.
Sprout Family helps co-ordinate fertility care through workplace benefits programs. She said many of its clients, including larger Canadian organizations, plan to treat Monday like a holiday.
“It felt like it was the right business decision to give our employees a day to rest and recharge, while also not having as much of a direct impact on the business,” Mason said.
Mason said extending the holiday to match that of the companies Sprout Family works with can also make it easier for staff to disconnect, knowing they aren’t missing out on anything crucial.
“Sometimes when you’re on vacation and the business is racing ahead without you, it can feel stressful,” she said.
Vineet Johnson, founder and CEO of IRegained, said he’s made it a recurring practice to bridge awkward gaps between days off when they occur.
Johnson, whose company develops neuro-rehabilitation devices, said he did the same last December when Boxing Day fell on a Thursday and otherwise would have forced people to return to work for just one day before the weekend.
“It’s an easy incentive, a no-brainer incentive,” said Johnson.

right_lean,"Vice President JD Vance and Senate Republican leaders worked late Saturday to persuade reluctant holdouts to back President Donald Trump’s multi-trillion dollar tax and spending bill.


 — Vice President JD Vance and Senate Republican leaders worked late Saturday to persuade reluctant holdouts to back President Donald Trump’s multi-trillion dollar tax and spending bill. 




After a day of arm-twisting, Majority Leader John Thune called a pivotal procedural vote, which quickly drew three Republican “no” votes while several others remained undecided as the vote was held open. 
Vance, who would break a tie, met on the floor and in Thune’s office with holdouts, eventually helping to persuade Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski to support advancing the bill. But three others — Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Rick Scott of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah — had not cast their votes. 






The lobbying, which included Trump golfing with frequent foe Rand Paul and other senators, came as the party worked to rush the bill to the president’s desk ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline.
Senate Republicans unveiled a new version of their $4.2 trillion tax cut package early Saturday that adjusts key provisions on the SALT deduction, Medicaid and clean energy.
The new draft reflects compromises among warring factions of the Senate GOP, which has been divided over how much to cut safety-net programs such as Medicaid and how rapidly to phase out renewable energy tax credits enacted under the Biden administration. 
Thune has said he plans for his chamber to hold a final vote on the bill as soon as early Sunday. Democrats, however, are threatening to force the bill be read on the floor, which would likely push the final vote to Monday.
Party leaders plan to bring House members back to Washington early next week for what they hope will be final approval of the measure in time for Trump’s Independence Day deadline.
It is not yet clear if the 50 Senate Republicans needed to pass the bill are all on board. The bill can be further altered on the Senate floor to secure the votes if needed. The House could also make more changes if Speaker Mike Johnson has trouble corralling votes for the measure.
But Paul, as well as Senators Ron Johnson and Thom Tillis , voted against starting debate on the bill. 
“This is an important bill,” Johnson said. “There’s no need to rush it.”
Johnson, however, was later among the senators meeting in Thune’s office. He left open the possibility he could reverse his vote. 
Montana’s Tim Sheehy briefly threatened to block the bill before Thune offered him an amendment vote to strip out public land sales from the bill.
SALT Deduction
A tentative deal with House Republicans to increase the state and local tax deduction is included. The bill would raise the SALT deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 for five years before snapping back to the $10,000 level. The new cap applies to 2025 and rises 1% in subsequent years. 
The ability to claim the full SALT amount would phase out for those making more than $500,000 per year. A House attempt to curb the ability of pass-though businesses to circumvent the SALT cap was removed from the text. 
The deal has the support of most members of the House SALT caucus of Republicans from high-tax swing districts. While decried by conservatives for costing hundreds of billions of dollars, it has the blessing of the White House. 
Senate Republicans also deleted a Section 899 “revenge tax” on some foreign companies and investors that had spooked Wall Street, after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent requested the change. 
The Senate measure makes permanent individual and business tax breaks enacted in 2017, while adding temporary new breaks for tipped and overtime workers, seniors and car buyers.
Medicaid Changes
To win over moderate Republicans, the bill would create a new $25 billion rural hospital fund aimed at helping mitigate the impact of Medicaid cuts, which otherwise could force some rural providers to shut down. 
Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, however, had demanded a $100 billion fund.
Moderate Republicans also won a delay from 2031 to 2032 on the full impact of a new 3.5% cap on state Medicaid provider taxes. States often use these taxes, within some already existing rules, to draw down federal funding and increase payments to facilities like hospitals. Limits on the Medicaid funding mechanism would begin phasing in in 2028.
The cap on provider taxes would only apply to states that expanded Medicaid coverage for low-income people under the Affordable Care Act. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 40 states and the District of Columbia have done so.
The House-passed version of the bill proposed a moratorium on new or increased provider taxes, which the Congressional Budget Office said would save the federal government more than $89 billion over the next decade. 
The measure also would impose new work requirements on Medicaid recipients and require Medicaid beneficiaries who gained eligibility through the Affordable Care Act to pay a share of their costs through charges such as co-pays and deductibles.
Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who had criticized the cuts to Medicaid as too deep, said the changes were enough to gain his support while Collins said she “would lean against the bill” without more concessions, but would vote to begin debate. 
Renewable Energy
Senate Republicans moved up a cut-off for tax credits used for wind and solar projects even earlier then they initially proposed, amid pushback on the credits from Trump. The new measure requires those projects to be “placed in service” by the end of 2027 to receive the incentives, as opposed to simply being under construction by that time.
The change, if it makes into law, could be a blow to companies such as NextEra Energy Inc., the biggest US developer of wind and solar projects. But the energy tweaks may help get holdout GOP Senator Mike Lee to vote for the bill.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned Americans in a social media post that Republicans’ plan to phase out the clean energy tax breaks would “jack up your electric bills and jeopardize hundreds of thousands of jobs.”
Senate Republicans also would alter an existing clean energy tax credit so that it would also cover production of metallurgical coal, which is used in steel making.
The new Senate legislation would end a popular $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles by Sept. 30, earlier than in the prior drafts. Tax credits for the purchase of used and commercial electric vehicles would end at the same time.
The bill would slash funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, cut federal payments to states for food stamps and boost funds for a US-Mexico border wall among other things.
The version drops a provision explicitly terminating the IRS-run free electronic filing Direct File program, a loss for TurboTax maker Intuit Inc. But the legislation keeps in a $15 million pot of funding that creates a task force to study replacing the free electronic filing program.
The bill would alter a proposed new tax on some remittances by non-citizens, lowering it from 3.5% in earlier versions to 1%, in a win for Western Union and Moneygram.
The measure would avert a US payment default as soon as August by raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.

 — Some of the world’s biggest money managers are wary of chasing the stock rally further in the second half of 2025, bracing for more volatility.




Markets are wrapping up a wild six months that saw the S&P 500 plunge 19% from peak to trough, before it recouped those losses. The index closed at a record high on Friday after the ceasefire between Israel and Iran revived the risk-on rally.
The recent bounce is not enough for many institutional investors, who cite a litany of risks confronting equities. The fast-approaching deadline for tariff deals, a mixed outlook for earnings and questions around America’s debt and leadership of the Federal Reserve loomed large in interviews with investment firms. They’re also mindful of US-China tensions, potentially eased somewhat by the countries’ just-announced trade framework.






“We are more cautious than constructive,” said Joe Gilbert, a portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management LLC. “The outlook for the second half of the year is always framed by the starting point, and that starting point from the perspective of valuation and earnings growth is not that attractive.”
Gilbert’s view is typical of the downbeat sentiment among institutional investors from Singapore to London and New York as June draws to a close. It’s also reflected in equity positioning by global asset managers, which remains well below historical levels. 
Here’s more about five key risk factors that stock investors said they are watching closely for the rest of the year:
Tariff Deadline
An immediate threat to the equity rally lies in the July 9 deadline set by President Donald Trump to reach trade pacts with major US partners. The stakes are high as exporters without a deal will be hit with much higher tariffs than the current 10% level applied to most countries.
The UK is an outlier, having secured an agreement on paper. The European Union and the US believe they can clinch some form of trade agreement in time,  News reported Friday, while talks with India, Japan and many others continue.  News has also reported that the US is nearing agreements with Mexico and Vietnam.
Still, investors got a reminder of the risks of sudden turbulence in this area of international relations when Trump on Friday said he would terminate trade talks with Canada in response to a 3% digital services tax.
Investors generally agree that a tariff shock for markets on the scale of “Liberation Day” in early April is unlikely. There are also hopes that the deadline could be pushed out. Still, Anthi Tsouvali, a strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said that while “markets are not complacent anymore, there are risks until a firm deal is announced.”
Tsouvali said she has a neutral stance on equities. “There’s going to be a lot of uncertainty, a lot of volatility,” she said. “We are not taking active risk.”
Earnings
Corporate resilience has been a key support for the sharp rebound in US stocks since April. Analysts on average expect earnings for S&P 500 companies to rise 7.1% this year before an acceleration in 2026, according to data compiled by  Intelligence.
That will be put to the test within a few weeks as second-quarter results roll in. The last earnings season saw companies across the world pull forecasts for the year, citing cost increases and weak consumer sentiment.
A June survey by the Business Roundtable showed C-suite executives were more pessimistic than three months earlier, with fewer expecting to ramp up hiring or capital spending. That said, Trump’s $4.2 trillion tax-cut package — facing a key Senate vote in the week to come — could provide a boost to companies struggling with tariff hikes and costs to rejig their supply chains.
“Within this more challenging environment, you’ve got to think that those growth expectations have got to come down,” said Louise Dudley, a portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. For the broader market, “perhaps the most that we can expect is a sideways move from here,” she said.
Geopolitics
An end to hostilities between Israel and Iran has pulled oil prices lower, easing a worry for equity investors about how this would feed through to inflation and complicate the Fed’s path to interest-rate cuts. Still, the boost to sentiment is fragile as uncertainty swirls around the future of Iran’s nuclear program. 
“Despite this temporary relief, we continue to see geopolitical risk as structurally elevated,” said Francisco Simón, European head of strategy at Santander Asset Management. The firm retains an underweight stance on equities, favoring a “cautious and selective approach,” he said.
The fraught relationship between the US and China also keeps investors on edge. They will be scouring for details of a trade framework the two sides said this week that they have reached. Among key points are whether the agreement will free up access to Chinese rare earths for American companies and remove obstacles for Chinese tech companies in obtaining cutting-edge US chip technologies.
US Debt, the Fed
The US lost its last top credit rating in May amid deepening investor concerns over its ballooning debt. Meanwhile, Trump’s tax-and-spending bill is expected to add trillions to federal debt over coming years.
“We know that the problem is not going away,” said Neil Robson, head of global equities at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. He noted that a market meltdown sending bond yields surging and equity valuations plunging remains a low probability event. “But we got to be aware,” he said.
For Nicolas Wylenzek, a macro strategist at Wellington Management, the handling of the Fed Chair’s succession is also an important issue for investors. Trump said Wednesday that he has three or four people in mind to follow Jerome Powell when his term expires next year.
A risk mentioned by some investors is that the US experiences its own version of the UK’s 2022 “Liz Truss moment.” That was “partly triggered by uncontrolled spending, in combination with some questioning of the independence of the Bank of England,” Wylenzek said. 
“Could we see something similar?” he said. “There’s a risk that markets suddenly start to get worried that the next chairman of the Fed is not as independent as they maybe have been in the past.”
Valuations
With stocks trading at 22 times earnings in the next 12 months, the S&P 500’s valuation is well above its 10-year average of 18.6 times. Firms like Wellington and AllianceBernstein are among those expecting the multiple to remain elevated due to future rate cuts and the resilience of big tech companies. But others see the lofty price tag as an obstacle to buying more stocks.
“US equity valuations, particularly in market-capitalization-weighted strategies such as the S&P 500 Index, may have further to adjust if US economic conditions deteriorate,” said David Chao, a global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. “Markets outside of the US mostly trade at lower multiples, and we think the gap with the US will continue to narrow.”

right_lean,"Former Juventus president Andrea Agnelli has requested a plea bargain deal that would give him a 20-month sentence in a false accounting trial that contributed to his downfall at the record 36-time Serie A champion.




Former Juventus vice president Pavel Nedved requested a deal of 14 months and former Juventus sporting director Fabio Paratici and chief legal officer Cesare Gabasio each requested 18 months.
Prosecutors began investigating in 2021 whether Juventus, which is listed on the Milan stock exchange, cashed in on illegal commissions from transfer and loans of players. The case has also explored whether investors were misled with invoices being issued for non-existent transactions to demonstrate income that in turn could be deemed false accounting.






A decision in the case, which was moved from Turin to Rome, is expected in September, a preliminary judge announced Friday.
The case prompted Agnelli and Juventus’ entire board of directors to resign in 2022. Agnelli was then given two separate bans by sports authorities, the last of which expires in October.
Juventus was hit with a 10-point penalty in the 2022-23 season and then removed by UEFA from the Conference League for financial irregularities.
If the plea bargains are accepted in September, it could be the final step in the false accounting legal cases at Juventus and set up Agnelli’s possible return to soccer after his sports ban expires a month later."

 — It had all been going so well.




Since Mark Carney replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister, Canada’s relationship with the White House appeared to be functional again, on the mend after President Donald Trump’s tariffs and his unwelcome overtures about making it the “51st state.”
Trump put that rhetoric aside and called Carney a “nice gentleman.” At the Group of Seven summit in Alberta last week, host Carney envisioned a new trade and security deal with the US as soon as mid-July.
Now the prime minister faces a setback, and some are calling it an unforced error.






On Friday, Trump said he’d terminate trade talks with Canada in response to its digital services tax. The levy, which would mainly hit American companies, is loathed by the White House and by Silicon Valley: the US Trade Representative and technology giants like Amazon.com Inc. say it’s a discriminatory tax.  
The tax was made law more than a year ago, when Trudeau was still in power, and it had already prompted warnings about retaliation. But Carney’s government decided to go ahead with implementing it. The first payment is due Monday. 
Canada’s digital tax is similar to one that already exists in a number of countries. It’s a 3% levy on all revenue over C$20 million ($14.6 million) earned from Canadian users in a year, and applies to services such as online advertising, social media and online marketplaces — hitting companies such as Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms Inc. and Uber Techologies Inc. 
The market was caught off-guard by Trump’s broadside, and the Canadian dollar and trade-exposed stocks dropped. “Economically, we have such power over Canada,” the president said to reporters on Friday.
Carney called the negotiations with the US “complex” and said he’ll conduct them “in the best interests of Canadians.” 
Retroactive Tax 
Trade groups and experts lined up to say they’d warned this would happen, including the American Chamber of Commerce in Canada and the Business Council of Canada, an influential lobby group representing top CEOs. Michael Geist, the Canada Research Chair in internet and e-commerce law at the University of Ottawa, called Friday’s blowup “completely avoidable.”
“In the same way that Trump has delayed implementation of certain tariffs, there was the opportunity to delay this for a period of time, and frame it as being in the spirit of seeking a broader trade negotiated deal with the United States,” Geist said.
The tax is “highly complex” and was retroactive to 2022, which US officials said was unfair. “It does seem to me that Canadian officials were, for a very long period, quite dismissive of the risks,” Geist said. 
Yet others believe there’s nothing obvious Carney could have done to avoid a clash with Trump eventually, perhaps over some other irritant, like Canada’s dairy trade controls, which the president also complained about at the White House on Friday.
“It is a trip wire, in the sense that this isn’t submitting to leverage,” said Jim Balsillie, the former co-CEO of Canadian smartphone pioneer BlackBerry Ltd.
“It’s not personal — he does it with everybody,” Balsillie said of Trump and his tactics. “The mistake for Canada has been that it disproportionately made itself dependent on the US over the last 30 years.”
Many other countries also charge some kind of digital services tax, according to a report early this year by the Congressional Research Service, including the UK, which nonetheless recently struck a tariff-cutting deal with the US.
“It is a bit of a bargaining chip for Canada,” said Lori Turnbull, a professor at Dalhousie University’s faculty of management who previously worked in the Canadian civil service. “If we had folded on that before, then what? We’d have even fewer things to work with.”
“Maybe the government’s going to decide to do something different on the digital tax in response to some measure that the US might take,” she said. “I don’t think we’re in a bad position.”
Flavio Volpe, head of a group representing Canadian auto parts manufacturers, agreed, saying the Canadian side needs to keep a “cool head.” Some advisers who went through the renegotiation of the North American free trade accord during Trump’s first term have said it’s a bad idea to unilaterally make concessions on things the president wants — because he’ll pocket them, then come back for more. 
“This is a tough negotiation, not based in math. It is leverage over law,” Volpe said on social media site X.

right_lean,"California should pause Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to penalize oil companies if their profits climb too high, a top energy regulator said Friday while unveiling proposals aimed at addressing high gas prices.




The Democratic governor signed a law in 2023 giving the California Energy Commission the authority to penalize oil companies for excess profits, declaring the state had “finally beat big oil.” More than two years later, the commission hasn’t imposed a single penalty or determined what counts as an excessive profit.
Now, Siva Gunda, the energy commission’s vice-chair, says the state should pause the effort in favor of pursuing other policies to lower prices and maintain a steady oil supply — all while pushing to phase out reliance on fossil fuels over the next two decades.






“Together, we will evolve California’s strategy to successfully phase out petroleum-based fuels by 2045 while protecting communities, workers, and consumers, and foster market conditions that support the industry’s ability to operate safely, reliably, and successfully to meet demand through the transition,” Gunda wrote in a letter to Newsom.
Gunda’s recommended pause of the penalty would have to be agreed upon by the full commission. Newsom has pitched the penalty as a way to rein in profits by oil companies, but critics said it would only raise prices.
California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.61 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.
The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance, Gunda said. That proposal came out of a law Newsom signed last year after convening a special session aimed at preventing gas price spikes.
Gunda’s recommendations come months after Newsom in April directed energy regulators to work with refiners on plans to ensure the state maintains a reliable fuel supply as it transitions away from fossil fuels.
Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villasenor said in an email that the governor would review the recommendations and “advance solutions that maintain a safe, affordable, and reliable supply of transportation fuels for California.”
Two major oil companies announced plans over the past year to shut down refineries in the state, further driving uncertainty about how the state should maintain a stable fuel supply as California transitions toward renewable energy. Phillips 66 announced plans to shut down its Los Angeles-area refinery, and Valero said it would cease operations at its Benicia refinery. The two refineries combined account for more than 17% of the state’s refining capacity, according to the energy commission.
A group of about 50 environmental and consumer groups penned a letter to Newsom and legislative leaders Friday criticizing the proposal to pause implementing a penalty on oil company profits.
“California oil refiners do not need a bailout,” they wrote, adding that the state should “finish the job” it started to prevent prices at the pump from spiking."

right_lean,"PHOENIX  — Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed legislation Friday that funds up to $500 million in renovations to Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks.




The bill, which won bipartisan support in both of the state’s GOP-controlled chambers, will use sales tax revenue from the stadium and nearby buildings for infrastructure upgrades over the next 30 years, including improvements to air conditioning systems and the stadium’s retractable roof.
The team said it will also contribute $250 million for the renovations at the stadium, which is located in downtown Phoenix and is surrounded by small businesses and restaurants that see a boost of activity during the baseball season.






The legislation is one of a handful of bipartisan deals that Hobbs, a Democrat, prioritized negotiating during the session. She says the funding is a responsible use of taxpayer dollars, will provide good-paying jobs and ensure the Diamondbacks do not leave Phoenix.
Attendance at games has increased since the team’s 2023 run to the World Series, where the Diamondbacks lost to the Texas Rangers. This season they are averaging 31,420 fans per game — the highest in two decades.
“I’m not going to let Arizona lose the Diamondbacks,” Hobbs said Friday on the social platform X.
Derrick Hall, president and CEO of the Diamondbacks, praised the governor and said the team will now turn its attention to extending its lease with Maricopa County.
The bill cleared the Legislature June 23 after months of debate that included the question of whether the Diamondbacks could potentially leave unless a public funding deal was reached.
Other MLB teams have threatened to leave host cities if they did not get public financing.
The Oakland A’s, for example, complained for years about the Oakland Coliseum and an inability to gain government assistance for a new ballpark. Now the team is bound for Las Vegas, where a groundbreaking ceremony was held this month for a $1.75 billion ballpark that is expected to be completed in time for the 2028 season. Nevada and Clark County approved up to $380 million in public funds for the project.
And last year voters in Jackson County, Missouri, rejected an attempt to extend a sales tax that would have helped fund a ballpark for the Kansas City Royals and stadium renovations for the Kansas City Chiefs. Lawmakers in Kansas are trying to lure the teams with government subsidies, and Missouri is trying to keep them with its own financial incentives.
The Diamondbacks have spent nearly three decades in their downtown ballpark, which is owned by the Maricopa County Stadium District. In 2017, the team sued the district over funding for repairs and sought to remove a contractual clause preventing the team from looking into other stadium options.
A perennial problem has been the park’s air conditioning system and its ability to keep it cool in triple-digit summer heat, Hall said. Fans of country music star Morgan Wallen bemoaned the heat at a 2023 summer concert there, despite the retractable roof being closed. Concession stands ran out of water, and some people simply left.
Chase Field was one of the first MLB stadiums to have a retractable roof. Now seven out of the 30 teams play under one, including the Brewers, Blue Jays, Rangers, Marlins, Astros and Mariners. Chase Field also has a small swimming pool in right field, one of its most recognizable features.
The funding from the Legislature will not mean upgrades to the pool or to stadium suites, the latter of which was a sticking point for Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego. She got on board after the bill was updated to prevent funds from being used for suites and a cap was placed on how much money the city would contribute for a land deal should the Diamondbacks break from the Stadium District, according to Gallego chief of staff Seth Scott.
Hobbs is running for reelection, and while it’s too early to say whether the Diamondbacks funding will be part of her campaign messaging, it’s another bipartisan win, her campaign spokesperson Michael Beyer said.
Democratic state Sen. Mitzi Epstein, who voted against the funding, said Hobbs’ support for the bill was wrong and hurtful for Arizonans. She said she was disappointed that amendments to create public benefits such as free streaming of games failed."
right_lean,"A tech industry trade group sued Arkansas Friday over two new laws that would place limits on content on social media platforms and would allow parents of children who killed themselves to sue over content on the platforms.




The lawsuit by NetChoice filed in federal court in Fayetteville, Arkansas, comes months after a federal judge struck down a state law requiring parental consent before minors can create new social media accounts. The new laws were signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders earlier this year.
“Despite the overwhelming consensus that laws like the Social Media Safety Act are unconstitutional, Arkansas elected to respond to this Court’s decision not by repealing the provisions that it held unconstitutional but by instead doubling down on its overreach,” NetChoice said in its lawsuit.






Arkansas is among several states that have been enacting restrictions on social media, prompted by concerns about the impact on children’s mental health. NetChoice — whose members include Facebook parent Meta and the social platform X — challenged Arkansas’ 2023 age-verification law for social media. A federal judge who initially blocked the law struck it down in March.
Similar laws have been blocked by judges in Florida and Georgia.
A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the latest complaint and looked forward to defending the law.
One of the new laws being challenged prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm or feature it “knows or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care” would cause a user to kill themself, purchase a controlled substance, develop an eating disorder, develop an addiction to the platform.
The lawsuit said that provision is unconstitutionally vague and doesn’t offer guidance on how to determine which content would violate those restrictions, and the suit notes it would restrict content for both adults and minors. The suit questions whether songs that mention drugs, such as Afroman’s “Because I Got High,” would be prohibited under the new law.
The law being challenged also would allow parents whose children have died by suicide or attempted to take their lives to sue social media companies if they were exposed to content promoting or advancing self-harm and suicide. The companies could face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.
NetChoice is also challenging another law that attempts to expand Arkansas’ blocked restrictions on social media companies. That measure would require social media platforms to ensure minors don’t receive notifications between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
The measure also would require social media companies to ensure their platform “does not engage in practices to evoke any addiction or compulsive behavior.” The suit argues that the law doesn’t explain how to comply with that restriction and is so broadly written that it’s unclear what kind of posts or material would violate it.
“What is ‘addictive’ to some minors may not be addictive to others. Does allowing teens to share photos with each other evoke addiction?” the lawsuit said."

right_lean,"The head of British Columbia’s Interior Health authority is stepping aside six months early over staff shortages that forced the closure of Kelowna General Hospital’s dedicated pediatric unit.




The authority says the end of president and CEO Susan Brown’s tenure is among “key actions” taken by the board of directors and other leaders to reopen the pediatric department as soon as possible.
Interior Health also says in a statement Friday that four new doctors have signed on to the pediatric department, although it still lacks enough staff to safely reopen the unit, which has been shut since May 26.
The health authority says Brown will now focus on supporting the organization ahead of her pending retirement that was announced last spring.






Interior Health had said at the time that Brown would stay on as CEO until the end of this year.
Chief financial officer Sylvia Weir has been named interim president and CEO.
The closure of Kelowna’s pediatric ward is part of ongoing hospital staffing shortages that have caused rolling closures of emergency rooms across B.C.
The authority has said the closure could last until July 4.
The Kelowna hospital “remains equipped to support any children requiring emergency care although pediatric in-patients will not be admitted at this time,” the Interior Health statement on Friday said.
“In the meantime, we extend gratitude to the pediatricians providing on-call coverage to the emergency department and we thank everyone working at the emergency department for their efforts during this challenging time.

right_lean,"A deal signed in Washington on Friday has been touted as a major step toward peace in Congo following decades of conflict that has killed millions, including thousands this year.




The U.S.-mediated agreement is between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been battered by fighting with more than 100 armed groups. The most potent is backed by neighboring Rwanda, and it is not clear if it will abide by the deal as the group wasn’t part of the negotiations.
President Donald Trump says the deal gives the United States “a lot of the mineral rights” from Congo. His administration has pushed to gain access to minerals key to much of the world’s technology and is seeking to counter China, a key player in the region where the U.S. presence and influence have eroded.






Both the Congolese and Rwandan presidents are expected in Washington in a few weeks to “finalize the complete protocol and agreement,” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.
Here’s a look at what we know about the agreement:
The terms of the deal
The agreement details general expectations but is short on how it will be implemented, particularly in getting the key actors of the conflict — the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels — to lay down their arms, according to a copy seen by The Associated Press.
The deal emphasizes the two neighboring countries’ sovereignty, territorial integrity and peaceful coexistence, with a commitment to halt all hostilities and any support for armed groups.
Although it denies supporting the M23 rebels, Rwanda has said it is protecting its border and going after the ethnic Hutus, whom it accuses of participating in the 1994 Rwandan genocide and now working with Congolese forces after fleeing to the neighboring country.
Armed gangs involved in the conflict may be reintegrated into Congolese security forces only after individual vetting based on loyalty, fitness and human rights records, the deal says.
In what the U.N. has called “one of the most protracted, complex, serious humanitarian crises on Earth,” the deal includes a commitment to protect and facilitate humanitarian access for displaced people in Congo, estimated to be more than 7 million.
The two countries also commit to creating an economic framework “to expand foreign trade and investment derived from regional critical mineral supply chains,” including ones that “link both countries, in partnership, as appropriate, with the U.S. government and U.S. investors.”
Uncertainty over whether the hostilities will end
Analysts say it is going to be difficult for the M23 rebels to withdraw from the cities they seized during their major advance this year and that such withdrawal may either take a long time or another round of fighting.
Rwanda is estimated to have thousands of troops supporting the M23 rebels in eastern Congo. Even if Rwanda ends its support for the rebels, the M23 has been consolidating its grip in the cities it has seized, setting up local administrative offices and enforcing a new governing structure.
A team of U.N. experts said in a report in December that Rwanda was benefitting from minerals “fraudulently” exported from areas in the region under the control of the M23. Rwanda has denied involvement.
The rebels were not directly involved in the U.S.-facilitated negotiations and have not spoken publicly about the deal. And Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance, which includes the M23, told the AP in March that “anything regarding us which are done without us, it’s against us.”
Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe pointed to separate talks happening in Qatar that are meant to get both Congo and the M23 rebels to agree among themselves how they will end the fighting. He also said Rwanda agreed to lift its “defensive measures.” It was not clear if he meant withdrawing the troops that Rwanda has said are defending its territorial interests.
What Congolese think of the deal
Of five people that the AP spoke to in the conflict-battered region, none of them was convinced the deal would quickly end the fighting.
They called for caution in granting the U.S. access to the region’s minerals — resources that even late Pope Francis had reprimanded developed countries for exploiting to the detriment of the Congolese.
“We draw the attention of the Congolese government not to give in completely or to sell the Congo to the Americans just because the United States has supported us in restoring peace,” said Hangi Muhindo, a resident of Goma, the city at the center of the conflict.
“The commitments to the United States must not jeopardize the future of our people,” he added.
Some also felt the agreement is only a part of the solution and called for more dialogue and justice.
“We want peace now, but we don’t want the therapy to be worse than the disease,” said Prince Epenge, spokesperson for the local opposition political coalition."

U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly cut off all trade negotiations with Canada on Friday, citing Ottawa’s Digital Services Tax (DST) for the decision. The tax, enacted last June, targets U.S. technology companies that operate in Canada but pay little tax here. Under the new tax regime, the first payments are set to be collected on Monday, June 30. The Financial Post breaks down what you need to know about the DST and why it is infuriating Trump and Americans.










Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government enacted Canada’s Digital Services Tax Act in June 2024, with the rules coming into effect the same month. The federal tax is applicable to large businesses — both foreign and domestic — that meet two specific criteria: a total global revenue of €750 million and up, and over $20 million of profits earned in Canada annually. The legislation levies a three per cent tax on digital services revenue over $20 million, and is retroactive to Jan. 1, 2022, meaning Ottawa could stand to gain billions in DST revenue, according to some estimates. Taxable revenue includes those of online marketplaces, digital advertising, social media, and user data — which will primarily affect American Big Tech giants such as Amazon.com, Inc., Apple Inc., and Meta Platforms, Inc.
Under the DST, companies were required to register with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) by Jan. 31, 2025 and are obligated to file their first DST returns on June 30, 2025. The CRA has said that more than 500 companies have already applied to register for DST purposes, and expects more than 100 companies to pay the tax. If applicable companies fail to register with the agency, they could be fined $20,000 per year. If they fail to file a DST return, Canada could dole out a penalty equal to five per cent of the unpaid tax for the year, plus one per cent of the unpaid tax for the year for each month, not exceeding 12 months, in which the return hasn’t been filed.
According to the government, the goal of the DST is to ensure that major technology firms are taxed appropriately in the country. The legislation however, has come under fire from business groups on both sides of the border, with critics warning that the rules could further inflame Canada-U.S. ties. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce has argued that the tax could increase costs for consumers and risks “damaging our beneficial and lucrative trade relationship with the U.S.” The U.S. meanwhile, has long denounced Canada’s proposed rules, claiming that they unfairly discriminate against American firms. Last August, under the former Biden administration, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) launched dispute settlement consultations with Ottawa under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement over the DST. The U.S. has said that American companies are on the hook to pay Ottawa US$2 billion under the DST. “Only America should be allowed to tax American firms,” Trump said in a February statement. Tech giant Google LLC responded to Canada’s digital services tax rules by introducing an additional 2.5 per cent fee for ads shown in Canada starting in October 2024. Called the “Canada DST Fee,” Google said the surcharges will “cover part of the costs of complying with DST legislation in Canada.”
Other countries have enacted their own digital service taxes. Around half of all European OECD countries have announced, proposed, or implemented a DST, according to the Tax Foundation Europe. The U.S. has met those proposals with threats of retaliatory tariffs. Some countries’ DST regimes could be on the chopping block. France’s Council of State, which advises the government on the preparation of bills and other matters, recently referred the country’s DST to the Constitutional Council for review, marking the first constitutional challenge to the DST since the legislation passed in 2019.
For months, executives of U.S. tech giants have pressured American policymakers over Canada’s DST. Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Canadian business groups have also pressed the Carney government to abandon the DST. And while businesses and industry groups were holding out for a last-minute suspension of the DST, finance minister François-Philippe Champagne reconfirmed last Thursday that Canada is “going ahead” with the tax. “The (DST) is in force and it’s going to be applied,” he said. Parliament Hill’s firm stance on maintaining the DST comes despite a recent Group of Seven (G7) agreement that succeeded in axing the Section 899 “revenge tax” provision from Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” that would have taken aim at businesses from countries that the U.S. views as unjustly targeting American firms. Ottawa hasn’t ruled out shutting down DST discussions completely. “Obviously, all of that is something that we’re considering as part of broader discussions that you may have,” Champagne said last week, suggesting that the DST could be renegotiated given the ongoing trade talks between Canada and the U.S."
right_lean,"California’s energy market regulator is backing off a plan to place a profit cap on oil refiners in the state.


 — California’s energy market regulator is backing off a plan to place a profit cap on oil refiners in the state. 




Siva Gunda, vice chair of the California Energy Commission, said during a Friday briefing that the cap would “serve as a deterrent” to refiners boosting investments in the state. Gunda said the commission wants to increase gasoline supply in California after two refineries announced plans to close in the next year, accounting for about one-fifth of the state’s crude-processing capacity.
The recommendation marks a reversal from years of regulatory scrutiny by Governor Gavin Newsom and the California Energy Commission that contributed to plans by Phillips 66 and Valero Energy Corp. to shut their refineries. The closings prompted Newsom to adjust course in April and urge the energy regulator to collaborate with fuel makers to ensure affordable and reliable supply.






Gunda wrote in a Friday letter to Newsom that the commission should pause implementation of a profit margin cap and focus on fuel resupply strategies instead. It comes more than two years after Newsom and state lawmakers gave the energy commission authority to determine a profit margin on refiners and impose financial penalties for violations.
The state will be looking to increase fuel imports to make up for the loss of refining capacity, Gunda said. In the short term, California gas prices could rise 15 to 30 cents a gallon because of the loss of production, he said. A spokesperson for the energy commission said the estimated price increases would be mitigated by the plan presented on Friday.
Californians already pay the highest gasoline prices in the country.
Wade Crowfoot, secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency, said residents want the state to transition away from oil and gas yet they need to prevent cost spikes. “We get it,” he said. “We need to maintain affordability.”

The aggregate gross proceeds raised in the Second Tranche and First Tranche of the Offering (which closed on June 16, 2025) (the “First Tranche”) is approximately $0.75 million and the Company issued a total of 1,116,267 Units each priced at $0.67 per Unit in the Offering.
Each Unit consists of one common share of the Company (a “Common Share”) and one-half of one Common Share purchase warrant (each whole Common Share purchase warrant, a “Warrant”), whereby each Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one Common Share at a price of $0.95 for a period of twenty-four months from the date of issuance, unless the term of the Warrant is accelerated pursuant to its terms (the “Acceleration Provision”). In accordance with the Acceleration Provision, if the volume-weighted average trading price of the Common Shares is greater than $3.00 for a period of five consecutive trading days on the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSXV”), the Company will have the right to accelerate the expiry date of the Warrants.






Proceeds of the Offering will be used for general corporate and working capital purposes. No finder’s fees were paid in connection with the Offering.
The Units were offered by way of private placement pursuant to exemptions from prospectus requirements under applicable securities laws. All securities issued under the Second Tranche are subject to a hold period expiring October 28, 2025, in accordance with applicable securities laws and the policies of the TSXV. The Offering has received conditional approval from the TSXV and remains subject to final acceptance of the TSXV.
Certain insiders of the Company participated in the Offering and acquired 746,267 Units for $499,998.89 (the “Insider Participation”). The Insider Participation constitutes a “related party transaction” as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”). The Company has relied on exemptions from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements provided under section 5.5(b) and 5.7(1)(b) of MI 61-101 because the Company is not listed on a stock exchange specified in section 5.5(b) of MI 61-101 and neither the fair market value of securities issued to insiders nor the consideration paid by insiders exceed $2,500,000. The Company did not file a material change report in respect of the transaction at least 21 days prior to the closing of the Offering as participation of the insiders had not been confirmed at that time and the shorter period was necessary in order to permit the Company to close the Offering in a timeframe consistent with usual market practice for transactions of this nature.
The Offering was approved by the directors of the Company who are independent in respect of the Offering and who are not employees of the Company.
The securities described herein have not been, and will not be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), or any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or pursuant to available exemptions therefrom.

right_lean,"Wall Street is throwing a summer party with markets just closing out their best cross-asset advance in more than a year on receding fears of a global trade war, igniting a buying frenzy in everything from tech funds to junk bonds.


 — Wall Street is throwing a summer party with markets just closing out their best cross-asset advance in more than a year on receding fears of a global trade war, igniting a buying frenzy in everything from tech funds to junk bonds.




With the S&P 500 enjoying its first record since February, it’s the triumph of investor optimism at a moment of high uncertainty around the economy, valuations and government policy — with the White House delivering a Friday surprise by threatening to end negotiations with Canada over a digital services tax.
Still, bulls are latching onto signs of cooling inflation and improving consumer sentiment even as jobless claims rise, the housing market stays cool, global trade softens and hopes fade for an imminent Federal Reserve interest-rate cut. Rather than falter, bullish conviction has surged to levels not seen since Donald Trump returned to the White House, powering a lockstep rally across stocks, bonds, commodities and credit that rivals the broadest monthly gain since May 2024. 






Volatility that shook markets just weeks ago has completely faded, replaced by a headlong rush into risky bets. Retail traders have dived back in as systematic investors have hiked exposure. The exuberance now hinges on the economic backdrop delivering enough good news to justify stretched prices. 
“The market is exhibiting signs of complacency,” said Raphael Thuin, head of capital market strategies at Tikehau Capital. “Across a range of potential risks — be it trade negotiations, a broadening macroeconomic slowdown, geopolitical tensions, growing fiscal deficits, or rising interest rates — market participants appear to be pricing in optimistic outcomes.”
Worrywarts on the economy and markets have been famously wrong, month after month. Yet the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co. still put the risk of a recession at 40%, citing tariffs and the prospect of weaker household spending colliding with falling business sentiment. He’s among those fretting that global growth will slow in the second half of the year. 
While a report Friday showed US consumer sentiment hit a four-month high in June as inflation expectations improved, other data this week painted a less encouraging picture. Purchases of new homes fell in May by the most in almost three years. Recurring applications for unemployment benefits are now at the highest level since 2021, aligning with other data pointing to a slowdown in the labor market. Consumer spending declined in May by the most since the start of the year.
Those reports were backdrop to testimony this week by Fed Chair Jerome Powell before Congress, where he said interest rates would probably be coming down already if not for uncertainty around Trump’s trade policy. He joined a parade of central bank officials who made clear in speeches they’ll need a few more months to be sure tariff-driven price hikes won’t raise inflation in a persistent way.
None of that derailed the risk rally. The S&P 500 surged 3.4% this week and closed at a record high. Junk bonds extended gains for a fifth week as 10-year Treasury yields fell around 10 basis points. Bitcoin is back above $100,000 and Coinbase Global Inc. hit its first record since 2021. Altogether, the pan-asset tandem rallies in June of US stocks, long-dated Treasuries, junk bonds and the  Commodity Index set them for their best monthly performance in 13 months.
Volatility-controlled products have been amping up exposure, with one Nomura Securities International measure showing projections for the biggest buying spree since at least 2004. Quants chasing trends across assets have also bolstered their long exposure to stocks after turning short for a few weeks, according to Barclays Plc.
It’s precarious positioning for investors, who just endured one of the more volatile quarters ever recorded, said Julie Biel, portfolio manager and chief market strategist at Kayne Anderson Rudnick.
“People forget that FOMO isn’t unbridled optimism, it’s fear driven. So if we have weakening margins or earnings or employment data really deteriorates, there isn’t a lot supporting the market,” Biel said. “We learned the lesson earlier this year of why a narrow market isn’t a robust one.”
One sign of doubt under the surface: Popular funds tied to speculative bets that led the recent market gains — from tech disrupters and small-cap stocks to gold miners and uranium — are flashing signs of caution. Traders are loading up on protective options, with demand for downside insurance rising. In funds like the ARK Innovation ETF, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF and the VanEck Gold Miners ETF, options markets are pricing in significant downside risk, according to Barclays Plc. 
Brent Schutte, CIO of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company, isn’t chasing the bounce, citing stretched S&P 500 valuations. He’s tilted toward cheaper, small and mid-cap stocks and internationals.
“People have just been conditioned to buy the dip and until it doesn’t work, that will continue,” Schutte said. “Today you see weaker data, but no one pays heed to it just because it hasn’t really worked as a signal of impending economic contraction in the past.”

 — Canada’s equities benchmark quickly dropped on Friday after US President Donald Trump said in a social media post that he was ending all trade discussions with the country, claiming that it is implementing a digital services tax. 




The S&P/TSX Composite Index, which hit a record high as recently as Tuesday, ended Friday down 0.2% with the materials and consumer sectors dragging on the index. Gold stocks were particularly hard hit as bullion prices declined. 
“Everybody thought we were back to sunshine and rainbows,” said Colin Cieszynski, portfolio manager and chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management in Toronto, adding that the market reaction shows Trump’s comments were a “total surprise” to traders.






Cieszynski also said that “volatility is back” and investors should treat the comments as a precursor to more trade uncertainty in the coming months. “It’s possible this might a warning shot on trade,” he added. 
In the US, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes both pared gains after Trump’s comments but ended the day higher. The Cboe VIX Index hovered around 16.
Unless this latest trade dispute is resolved over the weekend, it is “probably going to trigger more profit taking,” said Brian Madden, chief investment officer at First Avenue Investment Counsel Inc.
Madden said he was was “pleasantly, but perhaps prematurely, surprised” when the US government backed down from a plan to raise taxes on foreign investors on Thursday night, which boosted optimism on Friday before Trump’s social media post about cutting off trade talks.

right_lean,"All the major banks passed the Federal Reserve’s annual “stress tests” of the financial system, the central bank said Friday, but the test conducted by the central bank was notably less vigorous than it had been in previous years.




All 22 banks tested this year would have remained solvent and above the minimum thresholds to continue to operate, the Fed said, despite absorbing roughly $550 billion in theoretical losses. In the Fed’s scenario, there would be less of a rise in unemployment, less of a severe economic contraction, less of a drop in commercial real estate prices, less of a drop in housing prices, among other metrics compared to what they tested in 2024.
All of these less harmful, but simulated, drops mean there would be less damage to these banks’ balance sheets and less risk of these banks of potentially failing. Since the banks passed the 2024 tests, it was expected that the banks would pass the 2025 tests.






“Large banks remain well capitalized and resilient to a range of severe outcomes,” said Michelle Bowman, the bank’s vice chair for supervision, in a statement. An appointee of President Trump, Bowman became the Fed’s vice chair of supervision earlier this month.
The Fed said it went with a less vigorous test because the global economy has weakened since last year, and therefore the test tends to weaken. Further, the bank said previous tests had shown “unintended volatility” in the results and it plans to seek public and industry comment to adjust stress tests in future years. The Fed also chose to not test the banks as heavily on their exposure to private equity assets, arguing that private equity assets are typically held for the long term and are not typically sold at times of distress.
The Fed also didn’t test for any bank exposure to private credit, a $2 trillion asset class that even Fed researchers themselves have observed to be growing alarmingly quickly. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston recently pointed out that private credit could be a systemic risk to the financial system under a severe adverse scenario, which is exactly what the stress tests are supposed to test for.
There was no wording or phrasing in the Fed’s press release, reports or methodology about testing or measuring private credit or private debt in this year’s test. The Fed did do what it calls an “exploratory analysis” of the private credit market, which concluded the major banks were “generally well-positioned” to withstand losses in the private credit market. That analysis was entirely separate and not part of this year’s test.
The Fed’s “stress tests” were created after the 2008 financial crisis as a way to gauge whether the nation’s “too big to fail” banks could withstand another financial crisis like the once that happened nearly 20 years ago. The tests are effectively an academic exercise, where the Fed simulates a scenario in the global economy and measures what that scenario would do to bank balance sheets.
The 22 banks that are tested are the biggest names in the business, such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which hold hundreds of billions of dollars in assets and have wide-ranging businesses that touch every part of the U.S. and global economy.
Under this year’s hypothetical scenario, a major global recession would have caused a 30% decline in commercial real estate prices and a 33% decline in housing prices. The unemployment rate would rise to 10% and stock prices would fall 50%. In 2024, the hypothetical scenario was a 40% decline in commercial real estate prices, a 55% decline in stock prices and a 36% decline in housing prices.
With their passing grades, the major banks will be allowed to issue dividends to shareholders and buy back shares of stock to return proceeds to investors. Those dividend plans will be announced next week."
right_lean,"An iconic tourist attraction in an area of western North Carolina among the hardest hit by Hurricane Helene reopened to the public on Friday, nine months after the storm brought historic flooding, destruction and loss of life.




North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein and other officials attended a reopening ceremony at Chimney Rock State Park, which is about 25 miles (40.2 kilometers) southeast of Asheville. The main portion of the park will now be open again from Fridays to Mondays to visitors who make reservations, Stein’s office said.
Stein also signed into law before the ceremony’s crowd another state Helene recovery bill finalized by the General Assembly on Thursday that sends $700 million to the state’s Helene relief fund and appropriates $500 million of that. And Stein announced a new tourism campaign to encourage travel and spending in the North Carolina mountains.






“Today’s reopening is a huge achievement,” Stein told attendees. “Chimney Rock is just one of the many places that make western North Carolina unforgettable.”
Last September’s storm swept away the ornate stone and concrete bridge across the Broad River to reach the portion of the park that contains the 315-foot (96-meter) high geological formation that’s shaped in keeping with the park’s name. The park, which also features hiking trails and other amenities, usually attracts 400,000 people annually.
A road had to be paved and a temporary bridge made from old railroad cars was laid over the river.
The reopening provides needed encouragement to those in adjoining Chimney Rock Village, where a third of the hamlet’s businesses were destroyed as river waters removed buildings from their foundations.
“It almost wiped us off the map,” village Mayor Peter O’Leary said on Friday. “The village knew one thing that was of utmost importance to our survival. We had to have Chimney Rock State Park open again.” Some village businesses are reopening.
Before Friday’s bill signing, the General Assembly already had appropriated or reallocated more than $1.6 billion for Helene recovery.
The new Helene law is the fifth relief package approved by the Republican-controlled General Assembly since last fall. The Democratic governor said Friday that he’s still seeking direct aid for small businesses and more funds for affordable housing. But he was still pleased with the legislature’s action.
“We have a lot of work to do, but it’s also good to take stock and recognize that today is a good day,” Stein said. The governor is also seeking more federal funds for Helene recovery beyond the billions already received by the state and by those harmed by the storm.
State officials say the storm caused more than 100 deaths in North Carolina and generated roughly $60 billion in damages and needs."

The funding for any purchase pursuant to the Bid will be financed out of the working capital of the Company.






The ASPP will terminate on the earliest of the following dates: (a) upon the expiration of the Bid; (b) when the maximum annual purchase limit under the Bid is reached; or (c) the ASPP otherwise terminates in accordance with its terms.

 — US Treasuries closed out a third-straight positive week in a rally fueled by bets the Federal Reserve is ramping up to cut rates at least twice this year.




The  US Treasury index posted a 0.8% return for the week in its best run since early April. It’s now on track for its biggest monthly gain since February.
The advance has been driven by several economic data points that reinforced rate-cut wagers and by speculation President Donald Trump will name a more dovish Fed chief. Fed officials Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman have also signaled in recent days they’d be open to lowering rates as soon as the next meeting.
“The market really got excited on the Fed dove narrative,” said Gregory Peters, co-chief investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income. That now “puts data more at the fore.”






The gains for the week came even after the bonds slipped on Friday. Yields on maturities across the curve rose following the release of economic data that pointed to firmer-than-expected inflation. 
“The market overshot a bit based on Waller and Bowman language and now we’re taking some of this risk off into the weekend,” said Ed Al-Hussainy, rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle Investment.
A  gauge of the dollar separately rallied to the day’s high on Friday after Trump said he would be cutting off all trade talks with Canada and threatened to impose a new tariff rate. Canadian government debt jumped on the news, outpacing developed market peers. 
The market could well find further support from supply-and-demand factors including Monday’s month-end index rebalancing, which has the potential to drive buying, and from a gap in the coupon auction calendar until July 8.

Traders are also fully pricing in two rate cuts this year, with the first coming in September. They currently see a less than one in five chance of a July rate cut, but will focus on plenty of fresh data next week, topped by the June employment report. 
That data is released Thursday ahead of the July 4 holiday. Job creation is forecast to ease to 120,000, down from 139,000 the prior month, according to economists surveyed by . The unemployment rate is seen nudging up to 4.3%, and while still contained, such an reading would mark a fresh peak since 2021.
“There is a little bit of optimism that rate cuts are coming, most of that is driven by governors Waller and Bowman basically referencing that July is in play,” Gennadiy Goldberg, head of US rates strategy at TD Securities told  TV. He said the rest of the FOMC was split in two camps calling for either two or no rate cuts this year. TD expects the next rate cut to arrive in October as by that stage, the Fed will have enough data on inflation and the jobs market.
“It is going to be a drift lower in rates, and that’s why our year-end forecast for 10-years is 4%,” he said.
Other tailwinds to Treasuries include proposed US changes to a key capital buffer, which Powell said should bolster banks’ roles as intermediaries in the market. Meanwhile, the removal of the Section 899 “revenge tax” proposal that had been worrying Wall Street had little market impact, though it could improve sentiment toward US assets at the margin.
Traders are also monitoring Trump’s proposed ‘big beautiful bill,’ which is nearing a vote in the Senate. It has fueled concerns surrounding the US fiscal deficit, weighing on longer-maturity Treasuries.
Wells Fargo strategists see the potential for the spread between 10-year and 30-year yields to widen to 75 basis points by end-2025, in what they describe as a “fiscal blowout” scenario. The difference in yields is currently around 55 basis points.
“We expect very long duration bonds to continue lagging their five- and 10-year counterparts,” a team led by Michael Schumacher wrote in a note. “The significant relative rise in 30-year yields is due to investor concerns about potential supply.”

In a letter sent to WSIB President and CEO Jeffery Lang on June 23, ONA called on WSIB leadership to end the ongoing strike by negotiating a fair agreement that addresses workload, mental health, job security and wage improvements.
“We are incredibly grateful to the Ontario Nurses’ Association and its president, Erin Ariss, for standing with us and recognizing the vital work our members do to support injured workers — including nurses,” said Harry Goslin, president of OCEU/CUPE 1750. “This letter reflects the growing support from labour and frontline organizations who know that our fight is about fairness, respect and the future of Ontario’s compensation system.”
ONA’s letter highlights the impact of unsustainable workloads, the toll on mental health, and the lack of investment in staff — while noting that the employer has spent more than $14.5 million on external consultants rather than its own workforce.






“Their words send a powerful message: frontline workers deserve better,” Goslin said. “We are proud to have ONA by our side as we continue pushing for a fair deal that reflects the value and professionalism of OCEU members.”
OCEU is calling on WSIB’s CEO and board of directors to break the silence, stop the delays and deliver a respectful settlement that reflects the essential work of Ontario’s compensation workers before Canada day.

Orrville, Ohio-based Smucker said Thursday it will also remove synthetic dyes from foods sold to K-12 schools by the 2026-2027 school year.
Smucker said the majority of its products — including its Uncrustables sandwiches — are already free of synthetic dyes. But some products still have them, including sugar-free jams and ice cream toppings.
Smucker said some products from Hostess, which it acquired in 2023, also contain artificial colors. Twinkies are made with Red 40 and Yellow 5, for example, while Snoballs snack cakes are made with Red 40 Lake, a dye combined with aluminum to keep it from dissolving in water.






Smucker joins a growing number of big food companies that have announced plans to eliminate artificial dyes. Earlier this week, Nestle and Conagra Brands — the parent company of Duncan Hines _ both said they would phase out synthetic dyes. Kraft Heinz and General Mills made similar pledges last week.
The federal government has stepped up its scrutiny of artificial colors in recent months. In January, days before President Donald Trump took office, the U.S. regulators banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation’s food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of potential cancer risk.
In April, Trump’s Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would take steps to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry."

right_lean,"A California judge has ruled the state’s bare-bones home insurance program’s handling of smoke damage claims is unlawful, a decision that could have wide-ranging implications as insurers increasingly deal with the aftermath of wildfires.




Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don’t torch the property. The decision Tuesday by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stuart M. Rice is a victory for homeowners in a state where the risk of catastrophic wildfires has intensified alongside a brewing home insurance crisis.
The specific case involved Jay Aliff, who sued in 2021 over the insurance payout for his house near Lake Tahoe, which was damaged in the November 2020 Mountain View fire. His lawsuit challenged the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, or the FAIR Plan, the state’s high-risk insurance pool or the last-resort option for those dropped by private insurance companies.






With high premiums and basic coverage, the FAIR Plan was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders could find a more permanent option. Today, it has become the default option for many, with the number of residential policies reaching 550,000 in March, more than double from 2020, state data shows.
Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven’t standardized testing for those contaminants.
The FAIR Plan has been scrutinized for years over allegations of summarily denying smoke damage claims unless there’s proof of permanent physical change, even though the California Department of Insurance has long determined that that threshold is illegal.
Aliff’s lawsuit claims that FAIR Plan at the time offered a fraction of the money he expected to cover the costs to remediate the damages, citing a partial denial letter that said the fire debris could be cleaned up _- and therefore didn’t qualify for coverage as a “direct physical loss” to the home.
“The things that burn are terrifying like lead, cyanide. It’s not possible to get that out with Swiffer,” said Aliff’s attorney, Dylan Schaffer, referring to the brand of disposable mops.
Schaffer, who is also the attorney in a number of other lawsuits against the FAIR Plan related to the smoke damage issue, said the new court ruling was a game-changer in California insurance law at a time when thousands of homeowners in the recent Palisades and Eaton wildfires are still fighting for coverage.
“It is the most important decision in California insurance law in decades,” Schaffer said. “It draws a line in the sand as it relates to where carriers can start carving out their liability and avoiding liability.”
The ruling said the way the FAIR Plan limits smoke damage coverage to its definition of “direct physical loss” was a violation of the law, stating that “this language limits coverage reasonably expected by an insured in a manner which is not conspicuous, plain and clear.”
The judge also said it was unlawful that the FAIR Plan required smoke damage to be “visible to the unaided human eye” or capable of being “detected by the unaided human nose of an average person” rather than “the subjective senses of (the insured) or by laboratory testing.”
“Being unable to resort to their own senses or laboratory tests, it is entirely unclear how an insured could determine whether a particular loss is covered or not,” the court decision noted.
FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean said in a statement that the insurer has been working with the state insurance agency to update its policy language and has already eliminated the so-called sight and smell test.
“Our goal is to continue providing fair and reasonable coverage for wildfire-related losses while maintaining the financial integrity of the FAIR Plan for all policyholders,” McLean said in a statement."
right_lean,"If an employer wants a resignation to stand, its actions must be consistent with that

“You are fired.” “No, I quit!”




Most readers of this column will have learned that an employer cannot seize on such a “resignation” with alacrity or rely upon it in any way.
Similarly, an employee who resigns in anger in the heat of the moment is allowed by the courts a reasonable amount of time to calm down, change their mind and rescind the resignation.
A quick letter from the employer accepting the resignation or even using it to swiftly hire a replacement changes nothing.
What if an employee resigns in frustration and goes on disability leave yet never officially advises the employer of their intentions?

The next issue of Work will soon be in your inbox.


Such was the case in Denton v. Parriwi Management Inc., involving a forty-eight-year-old employee who started as an apprentice mechanic and worked his way up to service manager of the company’s repair shop, supervising 15 employees and earning a salary of $178,000.
One day, with tensions high over COVID-19, the supervisor (and eventual plaintiff) walked into a room during an argument between his manager and another employee. The argument concluded with the employee finally stating, “I’m done“ and walking out — at which point the manager redirected his wrath to the supervisor, who responded by saying, “I’m also done,“ before walking out himself.
By then, the supervisor was already feeling fragile, having had to lay off half his workforce because of the pandemic. The laid-off employees were almost like family, as he had worked closely with them for many years. He had also recently lost his father and, on one occasion, had a breakdown in the office and been granted a week off.
Concerned about losing him, another senior executive quickly reached out saying, “Don’t throw your career away. We know we have a problem. We want to help you,” and apologized for how he had been spoken to. The supervisor’s boss, who had been so hard on him, also texted an apology that night.
The supervisor responded to these texts stating that he felt like a failure and was embarrassed and ashamed. His boss replied that he was welcome back anytime. “Take a break and get better.”
A couple of months later, the boss again texted to ask the supervisor how he was doing and, when the supervisor told him he was having difficulties, the boss said that he was “in everyone’s thoughts.”
The supervisor received short-term disability (STD) benefits but was denied long-term disability (LTD). When the LTD carrier wrote to his employer, the employer scuttled the LTD application by advising that it had seen no decline in his ability to perform his duties.
Once off work, the supervisor began experiencing a host of medical issues, including the discovery of a tumour that had to be removed, leaving other residual problems.
He never explicitly rescinded his resignation or stated that he intended to return to work.
One day, four months after he had walked off the job, the supervisor received a letter accepting his “resignation“ four months earlier.
Up until the date of the trial, nearly five years later, the supervisor had not looked for other work. His health did not permit it.
The case came before the King’s Bench for Saskatchewan, where the court found that the supervisor did not resign but was fired, either when he received the letter accepting his resignation or when his employer scuttled his application for LTD. The latter finding — that an employer hindering an employee’s LTD application constitutes a dismissal — is one I have never seen before and could be significant in many cases going forward.
Despite the supervisor’s relative youth and non-executive status, the court awarded him 24 months’ notice. Until two or three years ago, 24 months was only given in exceptional cases, but that amount, and more, has since become mainstream.
The supervisor’s claim for punitive and other damages was denied, however, as the court found that the company’s conduct, albeit clumsy, was not malicious.
If the company had not reached out to the supervisor to apologize and let him know he was welcome back, the outcome might well have been different. It did not act as if it believed the relationship was actually over. If an employer wants a resignation to stand, its actions must be consistent with that. The onus will then be on the employee to rescind their resignation relatively quickly.

 — The European Union wants to allow limited imports of carbon credits under a planned 90% emissions reduction goal for the next decade, in a bid to reduce the costs of its ambitious green shift and get member states on board.




The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, is poised to propose that certain high-quality credits from a new United Nations-supervised mechanism can account for 3% of the pollution cut by 2040, according to a draft document seen by  News. 
The 90% net emissions reduction goal will be a reference point on the way for Europe to achieve its binding climate-neutrality aim by the middle of the century. The EU’s executive branch plans to put its proposal forward on July 2, sticking to its tentative timeline despite concerns voiced by some member states at a summit of national leaders on Thursday. 






The commission wants the EU to stay the course, but it’s preparing to offer concessions to head off the threat to its green agenda from a rightward tilt across the 27-nation bloc. It also seeks to alleviate industry concerns that ever-tougher climate goals, coupled with persistently high energy prices, could deter investment in Europe.
The EU executive branch has a policy of not commenting on draft documents. The draft may still change before adoption by the college of commissioners.
Investors in international carbon markets have been closely watching the debate for signs of whether the region would open for credits generated under the UN carbon-trading mechanism, which was mandated by Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The commission wants to permit their limited use from 2036, according to the document.
Under the draft law, the EU would at a later stage specify detailed conditions for acceptance of the imported credits, such as “the origin, quality criteria and other conditions concerning the acquisition and use.” While the bloc formerly allowed credits generated by projects beyond its borders under its Emissions Trading System, it banned them in 2021 amid concerns over environmental integrity. 
In the proposal, the commission also plans to pledge other options for cutting carbon that would be included in separate laws in the next steps. Those would include the use of so-called removals — activities that remove or prevent carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere — as well as an elastic approach to pollution cuts across various sectors of the economy.
The draft also includes commitments by the EU’s regulatory arm to take into account social and economic impacts, ensure competitiveness of the bloc’s economy and energy affordability when drafting more detailed rules on how to implement the goal. 
Still, it stops short of providing details on how exactly the emissions reductions will be achieved, risking opposition by some member states. 
A group of EU leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, raised the issue of the target at a summit in Brussels on Thursday, highlighting the need to ensure that decarbonization and competitiveness go hand in hand. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala rejected the plan to cut pollution by 90%, calling for a realistic goal.

 — President Donald Trump amped up pressure on Congress to speed passage of his tax-cut bill as Republicans reached a tentative deal on the state and local tax deduction, one of the key sticking points in the negotiations.




“The House of Representatives must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th — We can get it done,” Trump said on Truth Social Friday.
The new deadline — before July 4 — is somewhat of a reversal for the president who, hours earlier told reporters that it wouldn’t be the “end-all” if Congress missed the self-imposed Independence Day goal.






On Friday afternoon, the tentative SALT deal suggested that Republicans may have momentum on their side. The agreement involved raising the limit on the state and local tax deduction to $40,000 a year for a five-year period, Senator John Hoeven told reporters.
New York Republican Mike Lawler, a key negotiator, later confirmed the deal and told  TV he believes it “will pass.” The new cap would provide complete SALT relief to more than 90% of his constituents, he estimated.
But the SALT Caucus isn’t united on the agreement, with Nick LaLota of New York refusing to back the deal because it would ultimately revert back to the $10,000 cap.  
“While I support the President’s broader agenda, I can’t in good conscience back the same unfair $10,000 SALT cap I’ve spent years criticizing,” the New York Republican said in a statement. “My constituents would see that for what it is —hypocrisy.”
His opposition is potentially problematic for Republicans in the narrowly divided House, where every vote matters.
Lawler, LaLota and other GOP lawmakers from New York, New Jersey and California had pressed to preserve a deal included in the House bill that increased the deduction cap to $40,000, up from the $10,000 in current law, for 10 years. The original Senate draft kept the write-off at $10,000.
The latest deal retains a House proposal to phase out the deduction for taxpayers with at least $500,000 in income, a person familiar said, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.
Republicans also plan to drop new limits they had sought on pass-through businesses’ deductions of state and local tax taxes, the person said.
Until now, some business owners in most states haven’t actually needed to abide by the SALT cap that applies to everyone else, thanks to legal workarounds approved by legislatures in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California and dozens of other states.
The House version of Trump’s massive tax and spending package put curbs on those workarounds.
The SALT provision has been one of several holdups for the Trump tax bill in the Senate.
Senate Republican Leader John Thune is also trying to navigate competing demands from conservatives and moderates on social safety net cuts and the elimination of clean energy tax credits. He will need to resolve most of the disputes to secure the votes he needs to pass the bill. 
Senators said the tentative plan is to begin voting on the bill Saturday midday. 
The massive tax and spending package is the legislative centerpiece of Trump’s economic agenda. The Senate version makes permanent individual and business tax breaks enacted in 2017, while adding temporary new breaks for tipped and overtime workers, seniors and car-buyers. 
The bill would add hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending for the military, border patrol and immigration enforcement. To partly pay for the revenue losses, the bill reduces spending on Medicaid health insurance for the poor and disabled, food assistance for low-income Americans and financial aid to college students.
The measure would also avert a US payment default as soon as August by raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.

right_lean,"President Donald Trump said he was ending all trade discussions with Canada in retaliation for the country’s digital services tax and threatened to impose a fresh tariff rate within the next week.


 — President Donald Trump said he was ending all trade discussions with Canada in retaliation for the country’s digital services tax and threatened to impose a fresh tariff rate within the next week.




“Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately. We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period,” Trump posted Friday on social media.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on CNBC that he expects the administration will launch a so-called Section 301 investigation into Canada, a tool the US has used against other countries including China, which may lead to higher import taxes. 






Canada and the US have one of the world’s largest bilateral trading relationships, exchanging more than $900 billion of goods and services last year. But the alliance has grown tense since Trump won the election. The president threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and repeatedly said he thinks it should become the 51st US state. Since taking office, he has put taxes on steel, aluminum and automobiles and other goods. 
In response, many Canadians have boycotted US products and avoided travel to US destinations. 
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, speaking briefly on his way out of a meeting on Friday, said he hadn’t spoken with Trump since his post. “We’ll continue to conduct these complex negotiations in the best interests of Canadians,” he said.
The Canadian dollar dropped more than 0.5% almost immediately after Trump’s post before reversing those losses. Canada’s benchmark equity index fell, ending the day down 0.2%, and the shares of companies that rely on moving goods across the border, including General Motors Co. and apparel maker Canada Goose Holdings Inc., also took a hit. 
Dozens of countries face a July 9 deadline for Trump’s higher tariffs to kick back into place, and have been engaged in negotiations with the US. That deadline doesn’t apply to Canada and Mexico. The president imposed tariffs on the US’s North American neighbors earlier this year over fentanyl trafficking and migration concerns, and talks with them are being handled on a separate track. 
Last week, Trump and Carney met at the Group of Seven leaders’ summit and agreed to try to hash out an agreement by the middle of July. 
Business groups and some politicians quickly applied pressure on Carney to drop the digital tax. “In an effort to get trade negotiations back on track, Canada should put forward an immediate proposal to eliminate the DST in exchange for an elimination of tariffs from the United States,” said Goldy Hyder, chief executive officer of the Business Council of Canada. 
Ontario Premier Doug Ford reiterated his call for the prime minister to abandon the digital tax. 
“We’ve long supported the idea that global tech giants should pay their fair share in the countries where they operate. But the digital services tax hasn’t achieved that,” the Council of Canadian Innovators, which represents technology executives, said in a statement. “It’s functionally a pass-through cost paid by Canadian advertisers and consumers, and it leaves our economy exposed to draconian trade retaliation.”
Bessent on Thursday announced a deal with other G-7 countries that will exclude US companies from some taxes imposed by other countries in exchange for removing the Section 899 “revenge tax” from the administration’s tax bill. However, the deal didn’t address digital services taxes, which are in place in a number of countries but are opposed by Trump and his officials. 
Canada’s digital tax isn’t new. It was passed into law a year ago but companies haven’t had to pay it yet. 
The government will proceed with implementing it, with the first payments due Monday, Canada’s finance department said earlier Friday, before Trump’s post. Business groups had warned it would increase the cost of services and invite retaliation by the US.
A group of 21 US lawmakers wrote to Trump earlier this month asking him to push for the tax’s removal, estimating it will cost American companies $2 billion. Trump has long railed against taxes and other non-tariff barriers, casting them as an impediment to US exporters.
“We were hoping as a sign of goodwill that the new Carney administration would at least put a brake on that during the trade talks,” Bessent said on CNBC. “They seem not to have.”
The US specifically asked for a 30-day delay in the tax when Trump and Carney met at the G-7, according to Kevin Hassett, Trump’s National Economic Council Director, who spoke Friday in an interview with Fox Business.
The Canadian digital services tax is similar to those implemented by other countries, including the UK. The levy is 3% of the digital services revenue that a firm makes from Canadian users above C$20 million ($14.6 million) in a year. 
It would apply to megacap technology companies including Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. and has been criticized by smaller players including Uber Technologies Inc. and Etsy Inc. “We are disappointed by the Canadian government’s decision to implement a discriminatory tax that will harm Canadian consumers, and we hope that this matter can be quickly resolved,” a spokesperson for Amazon said in an emailed statement. 
Canadian Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne suggested last week that the digital tax may be renegotiated as part of US-Canada trade discussions. 
“Obviously, all of that is something that we’re considering as part of broader discussions that you may have,” he said.

right_lean,"President Donald Trump said Friday that he’s suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to continue with its tax on technology firms, which he called “a direct and blatant attack on our country.”




Trump, in a post on his social media network, said Canada had just informed the U.S. that it was sticking to its plan to impose the digital services tax, which applies to Canadian and foreign businesses that engage with online users in Canada. The tax is set to go into effect Monday.
“Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately. We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period,” Trump said in his post.






Trump’s announcement was the latest swerve in the trade war he’s launched since taking office for a second term in January. Progress with Canada has been a roller coaster, starting with the U.S. president poking at the nation’s northern neighbor and repeatedly suggesting it would be absorbed as a U.S. state.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday that his country would “continue to conduct these complex negotiations in the best interests of Canadians. It’s a negotiation.”
Trump later said he expects that Canada will remove the tax.
“Economically we have such power over Canada. We’d rather not use it,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “It’s not going to work out well for Canada. They were foolish to do it.”
When asked if Canada could do anything to restart talks, he suggested Canada could remove the tax, predicted it will but said, “It doesn’t matter to me.”
Carney visited Trump in May at the White House, where he was polite but firm. Trump last week traveled to Canada for the G7 summit in Alberta, where Carney said that Canada and the U.S. had set a 30-day deadline for trade talks.
The digital services tax will hit companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It will apply retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion U.S. bill due at the end of the month.
“We appreciate the Administration’s decisive response to Canada’s discriminatory tax on U.S. digital exports,” Matt Schruers, chief executive of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, said in a statement.
Canada and the U.S. have been discussing easing a series of steep tariffs Trump imposed on goods from America’s neighbor.
The Republican president earlier told reporters that the U.S. was soon preparing to send letters to different countries, informing them of the new tariff rate his administration would impose on them.
Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as 25% tariffs on autos. He is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the 90-day negotiating period he set would expire.
Canada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, though some products are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Trump’s first term.
Addressing reporters after a private meeting with Republican senators Friday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent declined to comment on news that Trump had ended trade talks with Canada.
“I was in the meeting,” Bessent said before moving on to the next question.
About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well.
Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager to obtain.
About 80% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S.
Daniel Beland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said it is a domestic tax issue, but it has been a source of tensions between Canada and the United States for a while because it targets U.S. tech giants.
“The Digital Services Tax Act was signed into law a year ago so the advent of this new tax has been known for a long time,” Beland said. “Yet, President Trump waited just before its implementation to create drama over it in the context of ongoing and highly uncertain trade negotiations between the two countries.”"

United States President Donald Trump said the U.S. is ending all trade discussions with Canada “effective immediately” and that he would unilaterally impose a tariff rate to access U.S. markets in the coming days.




In a Friday afternoon post on Truth Social, Trump blamed Canada’s decision to move ahead with the country’s digital services tax (DST), the first payment of which is due Monday, for cutting off talks.
“(Canada is) obviously copying the European Union, which has done the same thing, and is currently under discussion with us, also,” Trump wrote in the post. “Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately. We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period.”

Tech leaders and U.S. officials have long complained about the DST, which would hit large international tech companies doing business here, arguing it would increase the cost of services.
Concern about the taxation of U.S. companies abroad has been cited frequently by Trump as he launched a trade war against America’s biggest trade partners.
But the administration appeared to have reached a partial truce with G7 partners that would have cut the contentious Section 899, a measure that opened the door to retaliatory levies on countries that imposed taxes deemed to be unfair to the U.S., from a U.S. budget bill.
The move from Trump also calls into question a separate agreement struck at the G7 summit in Alberta earlier this month to reach a trade deal with Canada within 30 days.
“We’ll do what’s right for Canada,” Prime Minister Mark Carney said at the time. “We’re working hard to get a deal, but we’ll only accept the right deal with the United States. The right deal is possible, but nothing’s assured.”
The loonie and Canada’s benchmark share index both fell in the wake of Trump’s post.
Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay Inc., is optimistic Canada and the U.S. will find a resolution within the seven days Trump mentioned.
“We expect the issue to find resolution before the president’s deadline,” he said in a note. “Carney is likely amenable to reducing or eliminating an already-unpopular tax — but volatility expectations are again climbing across the currency markets as traders hedge against another round of negative trade headlines ahead of Trump’s July 9 ‘reciprocal’ tariff deadline, and measures of risk appetite are retreating. The Canadian dollar could remain on the defensive through the weekend and into the early part of next week.”"

 — The US dollar is poised to tumble further as Canadian investors — among the largest holders of American stocks — face pressure to raise their currency hedges against the greenback, according to TD Securities. 




“The loss of the dollar’s safety appeal since the start of the year has increased the need for these funds to hedge their long US asset exposure,” a TD Securities team including Jayati Bharadwaj, Mark McCormick and Linda Cheng wrote in a Friday report. More losses for the US currency “will give Canadian investors a greater push to adapt their hedging policies which can create further downward pressure on the cross.” 
The Canadian dollar has already rallied more than 5% against its US counterpart in the first half of 2025, the best start to a year for the loonie in nearly a decade. TD strategists forecast more gains ahead. They see Canada’s currency rising to C$1.31 by December, which would be its strongest level since 2022 and about 4% higher than current levels around C$1.3665. 






The TD team estimates that Canadian pension funds — some of whom have explicit policies to underhedge US assets — carry hedge ratios of around 10% to 15% on those holdings. Canadian investors hold some $1.8 trillion in US equities, more broadly. A 5% marginal increase in hedge ratios, consequently, could drive about $90 billion in selling pressure on the greenback versus the loonie, the analysts wrote. 
“Increased dollar hedging and potential repatriation paves the path for the dollar to keep moving lower sustainably for the next couple of quarters,” the analysts said. “The best way to position in this environment is to wait for dollar rallies to sell into.”"

Weather experts are warning that hurricane forecasts will be severely hampered by the upcoming cutoff of key data from U.S. Department of Defense satellites, the latest Trump administration move with potential consequences for the quality of forecasting.




The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it would discontinue the “ingest, processing and distribution” of data collected by three weather satellites that the agency jointly runs with the Defense Department. The data is used by scientists, researchers and forecasters, including at the National Hurricane Center.
It wasn’t immediately clear why the government planned to cut off the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s microwave data by Monday. The Defense Department referred questions to the Air Force, which referred them to the Navy, which did not immediately provide comment. NOAA did not immediately respond to a message.






Traditional visible or infrared satellites provide data that becomes images showing the structure, intensity and temperature of a storm, according to NOAA information, along with features such as lightning. But those miss the three-dimensional details of a storm. The microwave data gives critical information that can’t be gleaned from the conventional satellites, and helps peer under a regular image of a hurricane or a tropical cyclone to see what is going on inside of it. It is especially helpful at night.
The news is especially noteworthy during the ongoing hurricane season and as lesser storms have become more frequent, deadly and costly as climate change is worsened by the burning of fossil fuels.
Microwave imagery allows researchers and forecasters to see the center of the storm. Experts say that can help in detecting the rapid intensification of storms and in more accurately plotting the likely path of dangerous weather.
“If a hurricane, let’s say, is approaching the Gulf Coast, it’s a day away from making landfall, it’s nighttime,” said Union of Concerned Scientists science fellow Marc Alessi. “We will no longer be able to say, OK, this storm is definitely undergoing rapid intensification, we need to update our forecasts to reflect that.”
Other microwave data will be available but only roughly half as much, hurricane specialist Michael Lowry said in a blog post. He said that greatly increases the odds that forecasters will miss rapid intensification, underestimate intensity or misplace the storm.
That “will severely impede and degrade hurricane forecasts for this season and beyond, affecting tens of millions of Americans who live along its hurricane-prone shorelines,” he said.
University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy called the loss of data “alarmingly bad news” in a post on Bluesky.
“Microwave data are already relatively sparse, so any loss _ even gradual as satellites or instruments fail — is a big deal; but to abruptly end three active functioning satellites is insanity.”
NOAA and its National Weather Service office have been the target of several cuts and changes in President Donald Trump’s second term. The Department of Government Efficiency gutted the agency’s workforce, local field offices and funding.
Already, hurricane forecasts were anticipated to be less accurate this year because weather balloons launches have been curtailed because of the lack of staffing.
“What happened this week is another attempt by the Trump administration to sabotage our weather and climate infrastructure,” Alessi said.

right_lean,"Denmark is taking steps toward enacting a ban on the use of “deepfake” imagery online, saying such digital manipulations can stir doubts about reality and foster misinformation.




The government said in a statement published Thursday that a “broad cross section” of parties in parliament support greater protections against deepfakes and a planned bill is expected to make it illegal to share them or other digital imitations of personal characteristics.
Culture Minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt, in a statement, said that it was “high time that we now create a safeguard against the spread of misinformation and at the same time send a clear signal to the tech giants.”






Officials said Friday that the measures are believed to be among the most extensive steps yet taken by a government to combat misinformation through deepfakes, which refers to highly realistic but fabricated content created by artificial intelligence tools.
Deepfakes usually come in the form of pictures or video but can also be audio. They can make it appear that someone said or did something that they didn’t actually say or do. Famous figures who have been depicted in deepfakes include Taylor Swift and Pope Francis.
Authorities in different countries have taken varying approaches to tackling deepfakes, but they’ve mostly focused on sexually explicit images.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed bipartisan legislation in May that makes it illegal to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without a person’s consent, including deepfakes. Last year, South Korea rolled out measures to curb deepfake porn, including harsher punishment and stepped up regulations for social media platforms.
Supporters of the Danish idea say that as technology advances, it will soon be impossible for people online to distinguish between real and manipulated material.
“Since images and videos also quickly become embedded in people’s subconscious, digitally manipulated versions of an image or video can create fundamental doubts about — and perhaps even a completely wrong perception of — what are genuine depictions of reality,” an English translation of a ministry statement said. “The agreement is therefore intended to ensure the right to one’s own body and voice.”
The proposal would still allow for “parodies and satire” _ though the ministry didn’t specify how that would be determined. It said that the rules would only apply in Denmark, and violators wouldn’t be subject to fines or imprisonment — even if some “compensation” could be warranted.
The ministry said that a proposal will be made to amend Danish law on the issue this summer with an aim toward passage late this year or in early 2026. Any changes must abide by the country’s international obligations and European Union law, it said."
right_lean,"The first payment for Canada’s digital tax is still due Monday


Canada is proceeding with its digital services tax on technology companies such as Meta Platforms Inc. despite a Group of Seven agreement that resulted in removing the Section 899 “revenge tax” proposal from U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax bill.




The first payment for Canada’s digital tax is still due Monday, the country’s Finance Department confirmed, and covers revenue retroactively to 2022. The tax is three per cent of the digital services revenue a firm makes from Canadian users above $20 million in a calendar year.
Keeping the digital tax will not affect the G7 agreement, which focuses on global minimum taxes, the Finance Department said. The Section 899 provision would have targeted companies and investors from countries that the U.S. determines are unfairly taxing American companies.






“It’s a little bit surprising that the U.S. decided to withdraw Section 899 without having an agreement on the DST,” Ronald Nobrega, partner with Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP in Toronto. “If digital services taxes are addressed, presumably they’ll be addressed globally with the many countries that have a DST, not just with Canada. So this may be a process that takes many months or years to play out.”
Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne suggested to reporters last week that the digital tax may be negotiated as part of broader, ongoing U.S.-Canada trade discussions. “Obviously all of that is something that we’re considering as part of broader discussions that you may have,” he said.
Business groups in the country have opposed the tax since it was announced, arguing it would increase the cost of digital services and invite retaliation from the U.S. It also raised the ire of U.S. businesses and lawmakers. A group of 21 members of U.S. Congress wrote to Trump earlier this month asking him to push for the tax’s removal, estimating the June 30 payment will cost U.S. companies $2 billion.
Before scrapping its digital services tax, Canada wants to see an OECD deal on policies that expand a country’s authority to tax profits earned within that country even if a company doesn’t have a physical location there — which is different from a global minimum tax.
These extraterritorial taxes are part of a broader OECD effort to improve tax fairness globally, dubbed Pillar One and Pillar Two. But Trump has consistently railed against these efforts, arguing the policies developed are unfair to U.S. companies.

right_lean,"The latest sign of trouble in the U.S. housing market: A pickup in home purchase agreements falling through before they’re finalized.




Some 6% of pending contracts to buy a home were canceled in May, down from 7% in April, but up from 5% in May last year, according to data from National Association of Realtors. May is the third consecutive month with an annual increase in pending home sales cancelations.
A separate analysis of housing data by Redfin found that 14.6% of all pending sales in May fell out of contract, up from 14% in May last year, and the highest cancelation percentage for the month of May going back to at least 2017.






The trend underscores how even home shoppers who manage to ink a deal with a seller can end up having to back out because of unexpected costs, changes in their credit, employment or financial status, or a low appraisal, among other reasons.
“Stock market fluctuations, restrained consumer confidence and broader economic and geopolitical uncertainties may be leading to higher-than-normal cancellations rates in recent months,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist.
The U.S. housing market remains in a sales slump going back to 2022, as elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices nationally keep pushing the cost of homeownership well beyond what many would-be homebuyers can afford.
While sales of previously occupied U.S. homes in May remained at the slowest pace since 2009, pending U.S. home sales rose 1.8% from the previous month and increased 1.1% from May last year, NAR said Thursday.
A home sale is listed as pending when the purchase contract has been signed but the transaction has not closed. There’s usually a month or two lag between a contract signing and when the sale is finalized, which makes pending home sales a bellwether for future completed home sales.
A snapshot by Redfin of pending U.S. home sales for the four weeks that ended June 22, shows they fell 2.3% from a year earlier, the biggest drop in three months.
Economists at mortgage buyer Fannie Mae revised their outlook for existing U.S. home sales this week, citing expectations that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will end this year at 6.5%.
Fannie Mae now expects existing U.S. home sales will rise 2% this year to 4.14 million. The economists’ previously forecast the sale of 4.24 million homes. Still, they project home sales will jump 9.5% in 2026 on the back of mortgage rates easing to 6.1%."
right_lean,"A group of California Democrats is looking to ease the state’s gasoline standards and streamline permitting for refineries in a bid to prevent more fuelmakers from shutting down and raising costs for the state’s drivers.


 — A group of California Democrats is looking to ease the state’s gasoline standards and streamline permitting for refineries in a bid to prevent more fuelmakers from shutting down and raising costs for the state’s drivers.  




A bill introduced by seven of the state’s Democratic senators would require the energy commission to transition by 2027 to a less-stringent gasoline specification that’s in line with other western states, replacing California’s unique Carbob fuel. Nearer term, the measure would suspend rules requiring more environmentally friendly, but more expensive, fuel to be sold in the warmer months.
The bill marks a reversal from years of regulatory scrutiny by Governor Gavin Newsom and the California Energy Commission that contributed to plans by Phillips 66 and Valero Energy Corp. to shut refineries that account for about one-fifth of the state’s crude-processing capacity. The shutdowns prompted Newsom to adjust course in April and urge the state’s energy regulator to collaborate with fuel makers to ensure affordable and reliable supply. 






“Details of the policy are up for negotiation, but I will be fighting to ensure that we get needed change for Californians who are fed up with our fuel economy,” Senator Tim Grayson, one of the seven democrats who introduced the bill, said in an emailed statement. 
The limited number of refineries that can make California’s artisan gasoline grade is one reason why the state’s drivers pay more at the pump than the rest of the country. Among those were Phillips 66’s Los Angeles refinery, which the company said in October that it would shut later this year, and Valero’s San Francisco Bay Area plant, which the company said in April it is looking to close within a year.
Bill SB 237 was introduced in January, passed the California Senate in May and is working its way through the state’s assembly with a mid-September deadline of the current legislative session. If approved, it would pass to Newsom’s desk to be signed into law.
The bill would also establish a “one-stop shop” for air, water and hazardous waste permitting for the state’s refiners, who have long argued that a glacial permitting process and heavy regulation have raised costs and dissuaded companies from operating in the state. The bill’s streamlined permitting process would be available to refiners only if they commit in a “binding and enforceable agreement to continue to operate and to provide transportation fuels at an affordable price to consumers for the duration of the permits” issued through the process.
Chevron Corp. said the bill falls short of what’s needed because it doesn’t reduce the regulatory burden, reverse what’s known as the refiner margin cap or address permitting issues regarding oil drilling in the state.
“We are hopeful that California policy makers will reverse years of mistaken and anti-consumer regulatory choices, but we are not convinced this bill is anything but window dressing,” a Chevron spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Real reform is needed.”
Chevron operates the 269,000 barrel-a-day El Segundo refinery in Southern California and the 245,000 barrel-a-day Richmond refinery in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Richmond refinery agreed last year to pay $550 million over 10 years to avoid a local ballot measure that would have imposed a $1 per barrel tax on oil processed by the plant. The oil major also recently moved its headquarters from California to Texas.
To be sure, California’s fuel makers are still making solid profits. The latest data from the California Energy Commission shows refiners made $1 a gallon gross margin in April, down from 2024 but well above the US average.

Judy Sgro, MP for Humber River-Black Creek; and Angela Gauthier, Tribute Project donor and Board Chair, Villa Colombo Homes for the Aged Inc.
TORONTO, June 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — His Eminence Frank Cardinal Leo, Metropolitan Archbishop of Toronto led a public ceremony yesterday where he blessed the Villa Charities Italian Canadian Immigrant Tribute installation.






With over 600 people in attendance, the highly anticipated appearance by Canada’s newest Cardinal marked Italian Heritage Month and celebrated the remarkable history and journey of the Italian Canadians who have played such a pivotal role in this city and country.
The event took place in front of the Tribute installation at Toronto’s Columbus Centre. The gathering brought together community members, Tribute Project donors and dignitaries in celebration, highlighting the profound importance of the occasion.
The event began with opening remarks by emcee Antonio Giorgi from TLN Media Group. Speakers included Joseph Arcuri, Board Chair, Villa Charities Inc. and Marco DeVuono, President and CEO, Villa Charities Inc. Remarks were also delivered by Luca Zelioli, Consul General of Italy in Toronto; Hon. John Zerucelli, Secretary of State (Labour) and MP for Etobicoke North; Vince Gasparro, Parliamentary Secretary to the Secretary of State (Combatting Crime) and MP for Eglinton-Lawrence; Hon. Stephen Lecce, Ontario Minister for Energy and Mines and MPP for King-Vaughan; Michelle Cooper, Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Finance and MPP for Eglinton-Lawrence; and Angela Gauthier, Tribute Project donor and Board Chair, Villa Colombo Homes for the Aged Inc. Also in attendance was Hon. Judy Sgro, MP for Humber River-Black Creek.
Cardinal Leo delivered his special address and conducted the historic blessing of the Villa Charities Italian Canadian Immigrant Tribute installation. Following the blessing, a special plaque to commemorate the occasion was unveiled by Marco DeVuono and Cardinal Leo.
It has already been an extraordinary and momentous year for Toronto’s Frank Cardinal Leo. He was elevated to the College of Cardinals by the late Pope Francis in December, then mourned the Pope’s passing in April, participated in the Conclave and celebrated the election and inauguration of Pope – Leo XIV. After having lived through this series of significant milestones on the world stage, yesterday he had a moment to reflect on a different kind of journey—that of Italian immigrants to Canada, including his own parents.
“We were deeply honoured to welcome His Eminence, Cardinal Frank Leo, to lead today’s blessing,” said Marco DeVuono, President and CEO of Villa Charities Inc. “His blessing not only consecrates this physical space but also sanctifies the memories and contributions of countless Italian Canadian immigrants—honouring their enduring legacy of faith, family, and perseverance, and celebrating their lasting impact on Toronto and Canada.”
Villa Charities inaugurated the first phase of the Tribute installation and sculpture in November 2024 at an official unveiling at the Columbus Centre. The installation includes a fluttering wall adorned with hundreds of name plaques honouring Italian immigrants and their families. The landmark also includes the bronze statue titled Hope by marketing executive and artist Aldo Cundari, symbolizing the strength and dreams of a 1950s immigrant family.
Canadians nationwide not only have the opportunity to purchase plaques that will appear on the installation at the Columbus Centre, but also have their stories told on the Villa Charities Immigrant Tribute website. This allows donors to share family photographs and histories with the public, preserving their legacies and acting as a useful resource for future generations. In addition, as part of the physical installation, current donors can scan a QR code on the information panel to find on which section of the panel their family’s plaque is located.  
The funds raised from the Tribute Project through Villa Charities Foundation go to support senior care, youth services, education and scholarships, cultural programming, and capital needs.

right_lean,"Eavor Technologies Inc., a leader in next generation geothermal technology, today announced that John Redfern will be stepping down as Chief Executive Officer for personal reasons. Redfern, as an eight-year company veteran and co-founder, will continue his association with the company in a strategic advisory role. As CEO, Redfern has led the company from inception through numerous major accomplishments, including raising over half a billion in equity, overseeing first of a kind technology development through several demonstrations globally, and driving the team to its first commercial project in Geretsried, Germany which is scheduled to come on stream later this year.  




“I am immensely proud of all my colleagues at Eavor and what they’ve accomplished,” said Redfern. “We’ve gone from having this initially counter-intuitive idea for a closed-loop geothermal system, to now implementing the technology on a commercial-scale. It has been a privilege to be part of such an extraordinary team and its mission. You can be certain I will continue to support the Eavor team in any way I can as it embarks on this next stage of its journey and again redefines what is possible.”






In the interim, Robert Winsloe, currently serving as EVP Origination, will assume the role of CEO while the company conducts its search for a permanent successor. Winsloe has been with Eavor for eight years, demonstrating exceptional leadership and strategic vision, making him well-positioned to guide the organization during this transitional period.
“We are grateful for John’s leadership and dedication to Eavor,” said Doug Beach, Chair of the Board. “John’s vision has been instrumental in driving our success, and we are pleased he will continue his work with us in an advisory role. As we begin the search for our next CEO, we are confident that Robert will provide the requisite leadership and stability.”
Winsloe, one of Eavor’s co-founders and the architect behind Eavor’s market development strategy and the pipeline of Eavor-Loop™ projects around the world, also expressed his appreciation for Redfern’s significant contribution and the opportunity to step in as CEO: “I would like to thank John for his visionary leadership and dedication to Eavor in bringing us to within touching distance of first power at our commercial project in Germany. It’s an exciting time to step into the role and lead our incredibly talented team as we continue to focus on our long-held mission of making geothermal power development possible at scale, everywhere.”

right_lean,"Nike’s shares jumped at the opening bell Friday after the company said it’s shifting some production away from China. But it also warned that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration will cost it about $1 billion before it makes internal changes, which include “surgical” price increases in the U.S. starting this fall.




Nike is not the first retail company to warn of price hikes when students are heading back to school. Walmart said last month that that its customers will start to see higher prices this month and next when the back-to-school shopping season goes into high gear.
Walmart also cited higher costs from tariffs.






Nike is shifting production to avert looming tariffs in China. Production in China represents about 16% of the footwear that Nike imports into the U.S., Chief Financial Officer Matthew Friend said during a conference call late Thursday. That production will be cut to the high-single-digit range by the end of fiscal 2026 as Nike shifts production elsewhere, he said.
President Donald Trump and his Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said late Thursday that the U.S. and China have signed an agreement on trade, but provided no details.
Nike, Adidas, Under Armour and Puma were among 76 companies that signed on to a letter in April addressed to Trump, asking for a footwear exemption from reciprocal tariffs. The letter warned tariffs would “become a major impact at the cash register for every family.”
Nike said that it will begin to implement “surgical” price increases as part of its regular approach to seasonal planning, beginning this fall, Friend said.
The potential for higher prices from Trump’s tariffs have raised alarms for families, notably those who already spend a good chunk of money on equipment needed to participate in sports.
Also on Thursday, Nike reported a quarterly profit of $211 million, or 14 cents per share. Revenue totaled $11.1 billion. Both edged out Wall Street projections.
Nike is already facing a pullback in spending by Americans, who have grown anxious about the direction of the U.S. economy. While it’s still the most significant brand in sportswear, a “boredom factor” seems to have settled over the Nike brand, wrote Neil Saunders, Managing Director of GlobalData.
“In markets like China, where overall market growth has slowed a little, Nike is also on the back foot for similar reasons,” Saunders wrote. “We also see some anti-US brand sentiment creeping in, which is unhelpful and difficult to resolve.”
Shares of Nike, based in Beaverton, Oregon, jumped 15% at the opening bell Friday."

 — Romania’s premier outlined fresh measures to cut the ballooning budget deficit as the new government seeks to safeguard the country’s investment-grade rating and ease investor concern. 




The Black Sea nation plans to raise dividend and property taxes from next year, as well as put more emphasis on the performance of state-owned companies, according to Prime Minister Ilie Bolojan. These steps will be in addition to previously announced moves, including a temporary levy on “excessive” bank profits, higher excise duties and ending some exemptions to value-added tax. 
The country put an end to months of political turmoil this week, with the emergence of a new coalition government that sees curbing the European Union’s widest fiscal gap as its key goal. The pro-European administration unveiled a plan this week to cut the shortfall by about 30 billion lei ($6.9 billion), which it expects will bring the public deficit close to 7.5% of economic output this year.






“I want to tell investors that Romania knows its problems and it’s taking measure to tackle them,” Bolojan told reporters after a cabinet meeting in Bucharest on Friday. “We are in a difficult situation and it was only a matter of time until these measures became mandatory.”
The country, which has natural gas and oil extraction operations, should also consider recalculating royalties for its mineral resources, Bolojan said. He added that some data suggested a drop in economic activity in the second quarter, and that the government planned to present a detailed fiscal plan next week. 
While Romanian markets rebounded after the victory of a mainstream candidate in last month’s presidential election, the relief rally has stalled in recent weeks. 
The leu is the worst performing currency in eastern Europe this week, dropping more than 1% against the euro. The Bucharest stock benchmark is down 1% over the period, lagging most global peers tracked by . Yields on the government’s domestic and foreign bonds have reversed their decline.
Still, the government needs to tread carefully with unpopular measures as it’s already facing first signs of public discontent. Earlier on Friday, a minister said the cabinet plans to hand out vouchers to help the most vulnerable households cover their bills as a cap on energy prices is set to be scrapped at the start of next month.

right_lean,"Economists weigh in on what the latest GDP data means for Canadians

Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) is shrinking as the trade drama with the United States drags on, but economists say the economy isn’t as bad as some feared, so the decline may not give the Bank of Canada ammunition for making future rate cuts.




GDP declined 0.1 per cent in April, according to Statistics Canada, missing analyst estimates for flat growth and falling short of the agency’s earlier flash estimate for April for growth of 0.1 per cent.
It also forecast May’s GDP to shrink by 0.1 per cent.






Here’s what economists think the data means for the overall economic outlook and the Bank of Canada and interest rates.
“Canadian GDP was essentially held to a standstill over the three spring months; that’s not great news, but also perhaps not as bad as initially feared,” Douglas Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note, adding that growth was up 1.3 per cent year over year.
April was a month of “high drama” in the tariff story, with manufacturing contracting a “steep” 1.9 per cent and the auto sector pulling back 5.2 per cent.
Wholesale, transportation and warehousing, also vulnerable to tariffs, shrank as well.
“Given those deep drops, and the heavy uncertainty in the month, perhaps the surprise is that activity wasn’t even weaker,” Porter said.
He said real GDP would have fallen 0.2 per cent had it not been for several Canadian teams participating in the NHL playoffs and the lift from the federal election.
BMO expects annualized GDP to contract 0.5 per cent in the second and possibly third quarter, which is “certainly not good news, but also a less dire outcome than expected a few months back,” Porter said.
These estimates put the GDP outlook in the middle of the Bank of Canada’s worst-case scenario for the economy to contract by 1.3 per cent in the second quarter.
Porter said the GDP data and slowing growth make way for the Bank of Canada to restart interest rate cuts.
“However, the stickiness of core inflation remains a big hurdle for near-term rate cuts,” he said.
One more inflation report is due before the Bank of Canada’s next rate meeting on July 30.
“The resilience that the Canadian economy was previously showing in the face of U.S. tariffs and related uncertainty appears to be fading,” Andrew Grantham, an economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a note.
He expects the slowdown in the manufacturing sector, which posted its biggest monthly decline since April 2021, to grow, given the ongoing tariff uncertainty coupled with reports of some affected companies shrinking their operations.
Statistics Canada’s flash estimate for May highlighted expected weakness in the mining, oil and gas, public administration and retail sectors.
Still, with second-quarter GDP “now tracking for a modest 0.3 per cent contraction, the economy is certainly not falling off a cliff,” Grantham said.
He is forecasting average growth of one per cent for the first half of the year, but with momentum slowing in the second part.
That “suggests that slack in the economy is continuing to build and that further interest rate cuts from the Bank of Canada will be needed to support a recovery later in the year,” he said.
“We continue to expect the pain from trade uncertainties will stay relatively contained,” Claire Fan, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a note.
She said the GDP contraction in April could be sourced back to a “handful” of sectors particularly exposed to tariffs, including manufacturing and wholesale, while almost all the other sectors grew.
RBC expects the fallout from tariffs to continue to hit a limited number of sectors, “leaving the economy softer, but not substantially worse off by the end of this year,” she said.
Fan said Canada faces one of the world’s lowest tariff rates because the U.S. granted an exemption to goods that are compliant with the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement.
“The broader trade headwind will still slow U.S. demand for imports, including for Canadian goods,” she said. “But we expect Canadian domestic demand to broadly hold up, and the economy to not fall into a recession.”
RBC reiterated its call that the Bank of Canada is done cutting interest rates for this cycle.

right_lean,"The climate shocks that could trigger wider market turmoil


If you are over the age of 40, there is a good chance you remember where you were on September 15 2008, the day Lehman Brothers went bust. It was one of the first of many shocking moments during the last global financial crisis, a searing time of bank runs, crashes and bankruptcies when big economies tumbled into some of their deepest recessions since the Great Depression. Stunned Lehman staff, who left the 158-year-old investment bank’s offices carrying their belongings in cardboard boxes, came to symbolise the millions who lost their jobs, homes and life savings in a disaster that destroyed trillions of dollars of wealth.




There were multiple culprits for the mayhem but, as with so many financial debacles, the property market was implicated. In 2006, the air went out of a U.S. housing bubble fuelled by supposedly safe mortgage-backed securities that had been sold around the world and included risky “subprime” home loans. As the number of mortgage defaults and foreclosures climbed, the value of these securities plunged, saddling investors with crippling losses and prompting panic in financial markets.

The next issue of Posthaste will soon be in your inbox.


In the months after the crisis hit, government bailouts and sweeping reforms began to put the battered financial system back together. Today, big banks are better capitalised. Markets are better regulated and investors more protected as a result of those reforms. And yet each month now brings warnings with echoes of that strife. Fears are growing that property markets could again be roiled, this time not by risky lending practices but by rising numbers of climate-related disasters putting pressure on insurers and other critical financial institutions. “Property values will eventually fall — just like in 2008 — sending household wealth tumbling,” said Next to Fall, a December report on climate change and insurance from the then Democrat-chaired U.S. Senate Budget Committee. “The United States could be looking at a systemic shock to the economy similar to the financial crisis of 2008 — if not greater.”
In January, the Financial Stability Board, which was set up to keep an eye on the global financial system after the 2008 crisis, said insurance was becoming more costly and scarce in disaster-prone areas and “climate shocks” could set off wider market turmoil. In early February, U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell warned that the Fed was also seeing banks and insurers pull out of risky areas. “If you fast forward 10 or 15 years, there are going to be regions of the country where you can’t get a mortgage. There won’t be ATMs [and] banks won’t have branches,” he told Congress. “I don’t know that it’s a financial stability issue, but it certainly will have significant economic consequences.”
Less than two weeks later, Warren Buffett told shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. conglomerate, which includes a string of insurers, that property cover prices had gone up thanks to a major increase in violent storm damage. “Climate change may have been announcing its arrival,” he said. “Someday, any day, a truly staggering insurance loss will occur — and there is no guarantee that there will be only one per annum.”
Then, as Europe experienced its hottest March on record, Günther Thallinger, a management board member at Germany’s insurance giant Allianz, warned global temperatures were fast approaching levels where insurers would no longer be able to operate, creating “a systemic risk that threatens the very foundation of the financial sector.”
“If insurance is no longer available, other financial services become unavailable too,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post that made headlines. “The economic value of entire regions — coastal, arid, wildfire-prone — will begin to vanish from financial ledgers,” he added. “Markets will reprice, rapidly and brutally.”
There is no single scenario for exactly how property insurance costs might lead to climate-fuelled financial upheaval. But here is one that has emerged from discussions I’ve had this year with more than 20 investors, financial analysts, regulatory experts, insurance executives, scientists and researchers.
It begins with the number of insurers pulling back from U.S. states swelling from a stream to a flood, and not just in disaster-prone states such as California. Across the country, homeowners face soaring premiums or an inability to renew their cover as insurers confront a remorseless spate of wildfires, storms and hurricanes.
Cash-strapped governments try to plug the gaps with more last-resort insurance schemes. But these plans typically cost more and cover less, raising a chilling new reality for thousands of homeowners. The value of their family home, which had risen year after comforting year, instead begins to sink.
The contagion spreads because you need insurance to get a mortgage, so as property coverage fades, so does the presence of banks. In state after state, it becomes impossible to find a bank branch. Some lenders quit the mortgage business completely. A few begin reporting big losses. And the U.S. is not alone. Climate-driven upheaval intensifies abroad, rattling insurers, banks and property markets from southern Australia to northern Italy. In city after city, people find themselves living in homes worth less than what they had paid for them. Each monthly mortgage payment feels like throwing good money after bad.
In a disturbing hint of past financial turmoil, mortgage defaults begin to rise, along with foreclosures and credit card delinquencies. But this time, it’s different. Unlike other financial disasters, the underlying cause of this one is not financial, it is physical, and it is not clear how it will ever end.
It needs to be said that views are far from settled about whether a warming planet will ever cause this or any other form of financial disorder.
Christopher Waller, a U.S. Federal Reserve governor appointed during Donald Trump’s first term, has long been among the doubters. “Climate change is real, but I do not believe it poses a serious risk to the safety and soundness of large banks or the financial stability of the United States,” he told a 2023 conference in Madrid on economic and financial challenges.
Property values plunged after population declines in U.S. cities such as Detroit without posing a threat to financial stability, Waller argued. Why would declines in coastal cities hit by rising sea levels be any different? Also, Fed stress tests that typically assumed a fall in U.S. real estate prices of more than 25 per cent had found the largest banks could absorb nearly US$100 billion in losses on loans collateralised by real estate, plus another US$500 billion of losses on other positions.
Even experts who disagree and think there is a deepening climate-driven insurance problem don’t say this will automatically lead to the abrupt meltdowns of the 2008 crisis. Here’s how former California insurance commissioner Dave Jones, a Democrat, put it to me. “Over time you’ll see even more insurance company insolvencies, more insurance price increases and less insurance availability, more mortgage defaults, and falls in asset values and credit freezes; as opposed to a single catastrophic event or events where a bunch of financial institutions nationally go down at once.” Although, he added, “There is some risk of that as well.”
There is, however, wider agreement on one daunting point. Climate-driven financial havoc, even if it happens in slow motion, could be more menacing than past financial chaos. That’s because it would not be caused by financial failures that are typically followed by a recovery, but by global carbon emissions that the world has spent more than 30 years struggling to cut.
“This type of climate risk is not cyclical. It’s heading in one direction,” says economist Ben Keys, a professor of real estate and finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “So you don’t necessarily need as big a shock, if it’s a permanent shock, to have a serious, long-term effect on house prices and other asset values.”
This idea of a persistent climate imprint on real estate, one of the oldest and most important asset classes, marks a shift in the way some experts have been thinking about the relatively new concept of climate-fuelled financial instability. The story of why this shift has happened, and what it means, may seem remote when missiles are falling in the Middle East and Ukraine, and streets in the world’s biggest economy are filling with protests against authoritarianism. But in the long run, this is the story that may matter most, if only because it is so hard to see how it finishes.
For many years, analysts have thought there are broadly two ways that global warming might affect financial stability: the physical risks of extreme weather, and the so-called “transition risks” from government policies or technologies that disrupt fossil fuel-based investments by hastening a move to greener economies.
The two threats are linked: if physical risks intensify, they could in theory spur tougher climate policies that deepen transition risks. But physical dangers often seemed the more distant of the two when the idea of climate-fuelled financial problems first arose.
Mark Campanale was an early thinker about a climate crash and transition risks. He was a 40-something sustainable investment analyst in London in 2007 when he began warning about the threat of “unburnable carbon,” the fossil fuels that could not be used if global temperatures were to be kept at safe levels.
The contagion spreads because you need insurance to get a mortgage, so as property coverage fades, so does the presence of banks
And the Bank of England governor was far from alone. In 2017, eight central banks and financial supervisors, including those from China, Germany, France and the U.K., launched what became known as the Network for Greening the Financial System. The group soon had more than 100 members, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. The idea that a warming world could affect financial stability became mainstream. Suddenly, central banks were carrying out climate stress tests of banking systems that took transition risks at least as seriously as physical dangers, if not more so.
This analysis is still a work in progress. A comprehensive UN review of stress tests said last year the evaluations had broadly found that financial systems were likely to be able to cope with both physical and transition threats. But also the potential consequences were likely to be understated.
Critics have used blunter language to complain that too many stress tests are based on models that exclude risks such as climate tipping points. These are thresholds in the earth’s system that, once passed, trigger dramatic and irreversible changes, such as the loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet or Amazon rainforest.
“The consequence of this is that the results emerging from the models are far too benign,” the U.K.’s Institute and Faculty of Actuaries said in a 2023 report. “It’s as if we are modelling the scenario of the Titanic hitting an iceberg but excluding from the impacts the possibility that the ship could sink, with two-thirds of the souls on board perishing.”
More recently, Norway’s Norges Bank Investment Management, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, said some conventional models produced “implausibly low” estimates of physical climate risk losses while other analysis suggested far more serious consequences.
Models continue to be refined and central banks continue to work on what ECB chief Christine Lagarde last year called the “new type of systemic risk” posed by climate and environmental threats. But as it turned out, there was another type of hazard that needed to be addressed.
The U.S. administration’s rush to dismantle climate change policies since Donald Trump took office in January has been jaw-dropping. The president’s declaration of a “national energy emergency” aimed at boosting fossil fuels, and an order to again pull out of the Paris Agreement, were just the beginning.
The administration has since fired scientists at climate and weather agencies and drawn up plans to slash monitoring of greenhouse gases. Republicans in Congress have moved to repeal clean energy tax credits and other elements of Joe Biden’s climate policy centrepiece, the Inflation Reduction Act. Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said efforts to fight climate change were a “cult” as the administration began to dismantle rules restricting power plant pollution.
Separately, Trump signed Congressional resolutions aimed at overturning California’s efforts to boost electric cars and end the sale of new petrol-powered cars by 2035. As Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, posted online at the time, “Climate alarmism has had a terrible impact on human lives and freedom. It belongs in the ash heap of history.”
None of this means that the green energy transition, with all its potential consequences for financial stability, is dead. Last year, worldwide investment in the transition exceeded US$2 trillion for the first time. Nearly 40 per cent of this came from the clean energy behemoth that is China, which invested more than the U.S., EU and U.K. combined.
But the pace of global investment growth was slower than the previous three years, says the  New Energy Finance data research group. And if the U.S., the world’s largest economy, is now actively doing its best to reverse the transition, it casts an uncertain light on the immediate future of the shift.
Meanwhile, signs of the physical climate risks that initially seemed more remote than transition threats have grown ever more apparent. Monster rains brought Dubai to a standstill in April last year and forced thousands to evacuate in China. Hundreds died a few months later when Typhoon Yagi roared into south-east Asia. In October, authorities in Florida were still dealing with the wreckage left by two enormous hurricanes that slammed into the state within an unusually short 13 days of each other when disaster hit the Spanish province of Valencia. More than 200 people died after a deluge dumped a year’s worth of rain in hours.
Less than three months later, the world watched as enormous wildfires brought chaos to the Los Angeles area, killing dozens and razing thousands of homes including the mansions of Hollywood celebrities.
The pace of destruction has continued this year. In March, South Korean leaders said deadly wildfires sweeping the country were the worst in the nation’s history, while Japan ordered thousands to evacuate from its worst wildfires in decades. Massive wildfires have forced thousands of Canadians to evacuate, and Australia has faced a disastrous set of floods that officials say hit economic growth. This month, authorities issued extreme heat warnings across North America, Europe and Asia.
There is no let-up in sight in a world that is growing considerably hotter.
Last year, for the first time, global average temperatures reached 1.5C above pre-industrial levels for 12 consecutive months. Some time in the next five years, there is a chance temperatures could rise to nearly 2C for the first time, scientists said in May.
None of these events has led to systemic financial instability. Trump’s market-shaking tariffs had a far bigger effect. But the growing number of disasters has begun to change the way experts consider climate-driven financial problems.
“My thinking has always been that transition risk is a bigger risk for the financial system because it can take the form of very sudden shifts that lead to huge financial losses,” says finance professor Patrick Bolton, lead author of an influential 2020 publication commissioned by the Bank for International Settlements and Banque de France that said climate change could cause the next systemic financial crisis. “But I think what we’ve seen with the L.A. fires and other unexpectedly destructive disasters is that we’re already now in the territory where physical risks could be a threat to the financial system.”
Banks have had a similar rethink, says a financial services strategist who has worked on climate stress testing for nearly a decade. “For years it was assumed that stranded assets and other transition risks were going to pose the biggest threat,” he told me. “But the scale of extreme weather disasters in the last few years has forced a rethink because it shows that physical risks are intensifying a lot faster than originally expected.”
Lord Adair Turner, a former chair of the U.K.’s Financial Services Authority who helped to redesign banking regulations after the 2008 financial crisis, has arrived at a similar conclusion, albeit from a different starting position. He always found it hard to imagine a serious financial crisis could ever be unleashed by the transition risks that solar panels or electric cars might pose for coal companies or combustion engine carmakers. But he now thinks physical climate risks might do it.
“The fact that the severity of extreme events is hurtling up at a pace which we did not previously understand, and this affects an asset category as big as real estate, could leave lenders exposed to uninsurable properties that fall in price,” he says. “If I was to search anywhere in the world for something that could produce a financial crisis, that’s where I would primarily focus.”
Turner’s interest in the subject is not academic. He chairs the U.K.’s OakNorth digital bank as well as European arms of the Chubb Insurance group. He was also the first chair of the U.K.’s Climate Change Committee advisory body. That’s a useful background, considering the new information emerging in the U.S. about the way climate disasters are affecting home insurance. Or rather, the information that was emerging in the U.S.
Four days before Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, the U.S. Treasury’s Federal Insurance Office released what it called the most comprehensive data on homeowners insurance compiled to date.
Its analysis of 246 million policies issued between 2018 and 2022 showed insurance was growing more costly and less available for millions of Americans, especially for those in the most disaster-prone areas.
The average cost of premiums paid by people living in places where climate-related losses were expected to be highest was 82 per cent more than in the least risky areas. Those in riskier spots also faced much higher rates of non-renewals, where insurers decline to renew homeowners’ policies.
The report included information from bodies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Both agencies have been hit by efforts to cut the federal workforce and Trump has set out plans to start phasing out FEMA.
The Federal Insurance Office would also be eliminated under legislation introduced in January by a Republican congressman, which would leave U.S. states the sole regulators of the insurance industry. The move was backed by insurance leaders who called the office’s January report a “flawed” effort that focused too much on climate change rather than other factors that raised insurance cover costs, such as inflation, lawsuits and people shifting to risky areas.
Other insurers point out that, although extreme weather events can be significant, most have coincided with rising house prices that have so far formed a big buffer against mortgage delinquencies.
As for the risks to insurers themselves, industry leaders are quick to point out that they typically offer coverage for a single year, not the decades that a bank mortgage can last, so their financial exposure is more limited.
Meanwhile, work is being done to reshape insurance markets to make them more resilient to climate risk, push homeowners to build in less perilous places and make existing houses more resilient to weather extremes.
We must hope these efforts work. But we should also recognise that a number depend on data, analysis and shared expertise about the effects of climate change which is now under severe pressure in the US. A day after the Federal Insurance Office released its January report, the Federal Reserve said it was withdrawing from the central bank Network for Greening the Financial System that has driven so much work on climate-driven financial instability.
Two weeks later, the Federal Insurance Office said it too was pulling out of the network, in line with presidential executive orders on “Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements and Unleashing American Energy”. As the president’s agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, later told Fox Business, “We’re not doing climate change, you know, crud any more.” That’s because, as she said, “it’s a new day”.

 — Analysts boosted their forecasts for economic growth in Canada this year as fears of a drawn-out trade dispute with the US fade.




Economists surveyed by  say output will rise at a 1.4% annual pace in 2025, up from 1.2% expected last month. At that rate, Canada’s economy would trail only the US among Group of Seven countries.
They no longer see a technical recession, with the economy shrinking at a 0.5% annualized pace in the second quarter but now flat in the third. While still a period of weakness, that’s an improvement from last month’s survey, when economists expected a contraction of 1% in the current quarter and a small decline between July and September.
The survey was taken before Statistics Canada reported a 0.1% monthly decline in gross domestic product for April. Advance data from the agency suggest the economy shrank by a similar amount in May. 






Analysts say business investment won’t be as weak as they previously thought. They’re forecasting a 2.2% decline in the second quarter, compared with a 3.4% drop in last month’s survey.
The results capture positive developments in the ongoing trade dispute between Canada and the US. While the Trump administration continues to apply levies on Canadian steel, aluminum and autos, effective tariff rates remain relatively low.
Companies are avoiding tariffs by shipping goods through the provisions of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, and signs point to a possible de-escalation of the dispute. Prime Minister Mark Carney says he communicates regularly with US President Donald Trump, and the two countries set a provisional deadline of mid-July to get a deal.
Still, trade tensions are badly hurting many companies that sell abroad, as well as their employees. Exports are forecast to shrink 13% in the second quarter and imports are seen falling 8.1%, the survey data show.
Unemployment is expected to rise to 7.4%, peaking in the fourth quarter, up from 7.2% previously expected. 
Analysts believe the Bank of Canada will cut its policy rate to 2.5% at its July 30 decision and end its easing cycle when it reaches 2.25%.
In a speech earlier this month, Deputy Governor Sharon Kozicki said the bank was seeing “less talk of catastrophic outcomes” from businesses. Canadians are also feeling more optimistic about the economic outlook. Last week, the  Nanos Canadian Confidence Index rose to the highest since last November.
The survey of 33 economists was conducted from June 20 to June 25.

right_lean,"The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a Texas law aimed at blocking children from seeing online pornography.




Nearly half of the states have passed similar laws requiring adult website users to verify their ages to access pornographic material. The laws come as smartphones and other devices make it easier to access online porn, including hardcore obscene material.
The court split along ideological lines in the 6-3 ruling. It’s a loss for an adult-entertainment industry trade group called the Free Speech Coalition, which challenged the Texas law.






The majority opinion, authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, found the measure didn’t seriously restrict adults’ free-speech rights. “Adults have the right to access speech obscene only to minors … but adults have no First Amendment right to avoid age verification,” he wrote.
In a dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that the court should have used a higher legal standard in weighing whether the law creates free-speech problems for adults. “I would demand Texas show more, to ensure it is not undervaluing the interest in free expression,” she wrote.
Pornhub, one of the world’s busiest websites, has stopped operating in several states, including Texas, citing the technical and privacy hurdles in complying with the laws.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, celebrated the ruling. “Companies have no right to expose children to pornography and must institute reasonable age verification measures,” he said. The decision could pave the way for more states to adopt similar laws as one of several steps to prevent children from being exposed to pornography, the group National Center on Sexual Exploitation said.
While the Free Speech Coalition agreed that children shouldn’t be seeing porn, it said the law puts an unfair free-speech burden on adults by requiring them to submit personal information that could be vulnerable to hacking or tracking.
Alison Boden, its executive director, called the ruling disastrous. She said that minors have already found ways to find sexual content online despite the law and its “massive chilling effect on adults.”
The age verification requirements fall on websites that have a certain amount of sexual material, rather than search engines or social-media sites that can be used to find it.
Samir Jain, vice president of policy at the nonprofit Center for Democracy & Technology, said that age verification requirements raise serious privacy and free-expression concerns. The court’s decision “overturns decades of precedent and has the potential to upend access to First Amendment-protected speech on the internet for everyone, children and adults alike.”
In 1996, the Supreme Court struck down parts of a law banning explicit material viewable by kids online. A divided court also ruled against a different federal law aimed at stopping kids from being exposed to porn in 2004 but said less restrictive measures like content filtering are constitutional.
Texas argues that technology has improved significantly in the last 20 years, allowing online platforms to easily check users’ ages with a quick picture. Those requirements are more like ID checks at brick-and-mortar adult stores that were upheld by the Supreme Court in the 1960s, the state said.
District courts initially blocked laws in Indiana and Tennessee as well as Texas, but appeals courts reversed the decisions and let the laws take effect.
“There has to be a gatekeeper somewhere when it comes to exposure,” said Rania Mankarious, a mother of three and CEO of Crime Stoppers of Houston. “While nothing is full proof, we’re thankful to see something be done.”"

 — Oil held steady as traders weighed the uncertain status of nuclear talks between the US and Iran against reports that OPEC+ may extend its run of super-sized production increases. 




West Texas Intermediate edged up to settle above $65 a barrel after swinging between gains and losses.  reported that several OPEC delegates, who asked not to be identified, said their countries are ready consider another 411,000 barrel-a-day increase for August when they convene on July 6, following similarly sized hikes agreed upon in each of the previous three months. 
While that figure is broadly in-line with expectations, “the indications are that the group may go beyond the 411,000 barrel-a-day increase,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital. “Next, we should hear about the voluntary cuts under-shooting the goal from the group laggards. I expect the ultimate decision to be bearish for prices.”






Crude had earlier advanced as much as 1.3% after US Energy Secretary Chris Wright told  that sanctions against Iran will remain in place for now, and US President Donald Trump said he dropped plans to ease Iran sanctions. The statement comes just days after the president claimed that Iran and the US would meet for nuclear talk as soon as next week, which Iran denied. 
Oil still ended the week down roughly 13% — snapping three weeks of gains — after a ceasefire in the Israel-Iran conflict was reached, easing concerns about supply disruptions from a region that pumps about a third of the world’s crude. 
The focus has largely reverted to fundamental catalysts, including OPEC moves. Russia now also appears more receptive to a fresh output boost, in a reversal of an earlier stance, raising concerns of supply overhang in the second half of the year.
Investors have also turned their attention to progress on US-China trade talks. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said an understanding that was reached last month has been finalized, and China later backed up the assertion. The deal includes language on China delivering rare earths to the US, he told . Officials from both countries have maintained close contact after holding trade talks in London earlier this month, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said Friday. 
The trade understanding with China flagged by Lutnick comes ahead of a July 9 deadline for the US to decide whether to impose the “Liberation Day” tariffs on its major trading partners. The commerce secretary added that the White House has imminent plans to reach agreements with 10 major trading partners.
“Oil prices have stabilized at the level seen before the escalation of the Middle East conflict,” Commerzbank analysts including Barbara Lambrecht said in a note. “However, a further expansion of oil supply threatens to become a litmus test.”

 — Zimbabwe’s major power users are seeking as much as $350 million for an ambitious floating solar plant and have secured $4.4 million from the African Export-Import Bank for a feasibility study.




“We start the study immediately,” Eddie Cross, chairman of the Intensive Energy User Group, told  on Friday. “Total investment will depend on the study and open public tenders, but we have asked for $350 million.”
The IEUG, made up of mining companies including a former local unit of Rio Tinto and Mimosa, plans a 1,000 megawatt hybrid floating solar panel facility in Lake Kariba, the world’s largest man-made lake. It aims to complete a 500 megawatt pilot by the end of 2026.
Zimbabwe was stricken by power cuts last year after a severe drought curbed hydro-electricity generation at Kariba Dam, which produces half of the southern African nation’s power. Zimbabwe currently generates 430 megawatts at Kariba against an installed capacity of 1,050 megawatts.






Project financing will be structured as 70% debt and 30% equity, said Caleb Dengu, chief executive officer of Green Hybrid Power Ltd., which is helping its development. He said the debt would carry a 10-year tenure.

right_lean,"The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that Maryland parents who have religious objections can pull their children from public school lessons using LGBTQ storybooks.




With the six conservative justices in the majority, the court reversed lower-court rulings in favor of the Montgomery County school system in suburban Washington. The high court ruled that the schools likely could not require elementary school children to sit through lessons involving the books if parents expressed religious objections to the material.
The lack of an “opt-out,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the court, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion.”






Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent for the three liberal justices that exposure to different views in a multicultural society is a critical feature of public schools. “Yet it will become a mere memory if children must be insulated from exposure to ideas and concepts that may conflict with their parents’ religious beliefs,” Sotomayor wrote. “Today’s ruling ushers in that new reality.”
The decision was not a final ruling in the case, but the justices strongly suggested that the parents will win in the end. The court ruled that policies like the one at issue in the case are subjected to the strictest level of review, nearly always dooming them.
The school district introduced the storybooks, including “Prince & Knight” and “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding,” in 2022 as part of an effort to better reflect the district’s diversity. In “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding,” a niece worries that her uncle won’t have as much time for her after he gets married to another man.
The justices have repeatedly endorsed claims of religious discrimination in recent years, and the case is among several religious-rights cases at the court this term. The decision also comes amid increases in recent years in books being banned from public school and public libraries.
Many of the removals were organized by Moms for Liberty and other conservative organizations that advocate for more parental input over what books are available to students. Soon after President Donald Trump, a Republican, took office in January, the Education Department called the book bans a “hoax” and dismissed 11 complaints that had been filed under Trump’s predecessor, President Joe Biden, a Democrat.
The writers’ group PEN America said in a court filing in the Maryland case that the objecting parents wanted “a constitutionally suspect book ban by another name.” PEN America reported more than 10,000 books were banned in the last school year.
“By allowing parents to pull their children out of classrooms when they object to particular content, the justices are laying the foundation for a new frontier in the assault on books of all kinds in schools,” said Elly Brinkley, a lawyer for the group’s U.S. Free Expression Programs. “In practice, opt outs for religious objections will chill what is taught in schools and usher in a more narrow orthodoxy as fear of offending any ideology or sensibility takes hold.”
Lawyer Eric Baxter, who represented the Maryland parents at the Supreme Court, said the decision was a “historic victory for parental rights.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” Baxter said.
Parents initially had been allowed to opt their children out of the lessons for religious and other reasons, but the school board reversed course a year later, prompting protests and eventually a lawsuit.
At arguments in April, a lawyer for the school district told the justices that the “opt outs” had become disruptive. Sex education is the only area of instruction in Montgomery schools that students can be excused from, lawyer Alan Schoenfeld said.
The case hit unusually close to home, as three justices live in the county, though they didn’t send their children to public schools."

center,"Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he was hopeful a ceasefire could be agreed in the next week.

Qatari mediators said they hoped US pressure could achieve a deal, following a truce between Israel and Iran that ended the 12-day conflict between the countries.

In March, a two-month ceasefire collapsed when Israel launched fresh strikes on Gaza. The ceasefire deal - which started on 19 January - was set up to have three stages, but did not make it past the first stage.

Stage two included establishing a permanent ceasefire, the return of remaining living hostages in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

On Thursday, a senior Hamas official told the BBC mediators have intensified their efforts to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, but that negotiations with Israel remain stalled.

A rally was organised on Saturday evening in Tel Aviv calling for a deal to free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Organisers said ""the time has come to end the fighting and bring everyone home in one phase"".

Meanwhile, Israeli attacks in Gaza continue. Friday evening's strike near the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City killed at least 11 people, hospital staff and witnesses said.

One witness said they were sitting when they ""suddenly heard a huge explosion"" after a road was hit.

""This area was packed with tents - now the tents are under the sand. We spent hours digging with our bare hands,"" Ahmed Qishawi told the Reuters news agency.

He said there are ""no wanted people here, nor any terrorists as they [Israelis] claim... [there are] only civilian residents, children, who were targeted with no mercy,"" he said.

The BBC has verified footage showing civilians and emergency services digging through the sandy ground with their hands and spades to find bodies."
center,"The Italian media have leapt on the glitz and glamour of what they are dubbing the ""wedding of the year.""

Their pages and posts are full of pictures of the 200 or so A-list celebrities now in town, including Leonardo di Caprio and Kim Kardashian.

There's talk of cuttlefish banquets – tonight's spread will feature cod, cooked regional-style – and photos of the bride's white lace Dolce and Gabbana gown, apparently inspired by one worn by Sophia Loren in the 1950s.

It seems, however, that talk of this wedding bringing the city to a halt was overblown.

Ivanka Trump has been spotted at an art gallery, as has Bill Gates, and the newly married couple have been photographed and filmed in various locations and outfits.

But most tourists, or Venetians, are more likely to bump into a Bezos look-a-like, who made the journey from Germany specially to pose for photos, than any of the real-life rich and famous.

There are plenty of water taxis and gondolas still free for hire and no crowds of angry tourists, deprived of their magical ride.

Some streets were briefly closed around the main events but disruption appears to have been minimal.

Most of the posters declaring ""No Space for Bezos"" have been ripped down and just the odd bit of graffiti can be seen. Attempts to project slogans on buildings were quickly stopped by police.

A planned march by protesters on Saturday evening is taking place with official permission."
center,"A 28-year-old woman has described the ""absolutely awful"" moment she was diagnosed with terminal cancer just months after getting engaged and buying her first house.

Laura Lonergan fell ill while on holiday in South Africa in January 2024, and remembers a sudden loss of appetite, breathlessness, and weight loss.

""I'd been the same weight for about 10 years so I instantly knew something was wrong,"" she said.

Doctors initially put her symptoms down to a viral infection but after several scans she was diagnosed with stage three lung cancer."
center,"The bodies of 11 newborn puppies were found on the side of a road.

The RSPCA said many of the grey puppies still had their umbilical cords attached and their bodies ""were strewn along a grass verge"" in the village of Hoe, near Dereham, in Norfolk earlier this month.

The puppies were fairly large and thought to be some kind of bull breed, the charity said.

They added that vets thought it was unlikely all would have been stillborn or have died from natural causes, but a cause of death could not be established."
center,"Donald Trump's week began with an on-air expletive as he lost his cool over his mounting frustrations with Iran and Israel's shaky ceasefire.

It ended with a beaming US president holding court at the White House - not once, but twice - as he celebrated a series of significant political victories at home and abroad.

Trump was in a triumphant mood, answering questions for more than an hour at a news conference that turned into a checklist of his accomplishments.

Here's a look at four big wins from this week, as well as a reminder of some things that didn't go entirely the president's way."
center,"Next week, he is due to testify in a high-profile criminal case in which he's facing charges of political corruption, including bribery and fraud.

The prime minister's attempts to, again, delay the High Court hearings on account of his busy schedule and the special state of emergency (over the Iran war) were rejected at the end of last week.

Netanyahu and his supporters have repeatedly tried to portray the legal case against him as part of a ""politically driven witch hunt"" but in an increasingly polarised society, his opponents are equally determined he should face justice.

Appearing to belatedly learn about ""Bibi's"" legal troubles, President Trump said Netanyahu was a ""great hero"" and ""warrior"" whose trial should be ""cancelled immediately"" or, at the very least, he should be given a pardon.

This, remember, is the same US president who only days earlier had publicly castigated the Israeli prime minister – with expletives – as the Iran ceasefire deal threatened to unravel before it had begun.

But Trump's latest intervention has been described as unwise and unhelpful by many in Israel.

Opposition leader Yair Lapid said he should not ""intervene in a legal process of an independent state"".

His apparently contradictory stance on Israel and attempted intervention in Netanyahu's legal case was akin to ""treating us like a banana republic"", says Prof Hermann.

On the international stage, many Israelis accuse Netanyahu of having harmed Israel's global standing and its economic prospects by needlessly prolonging the war in Gaza, even though many former generals have said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has achieved as much as is militarily possible in Gaza.

It should not be forgotten, either, that the International Criminal Court still has warrants issued against the prime minister - and former defence minister Yoav Gallant - over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza, where more than 55,000 people have been killed in Israel's war against Hamas.

Israel's government, along with Netanyahu and Gallant, strongly reject the accusations.

Ultimately, say most commentators, it would be difficult to imagine new elections being called in Israel while the war in Gaza continues and while Israeli hostages remain captive.

But many of Netanyahu's critics and opponents have prematurely written him off over the years and have certainly learned never to second-guess what his next move might be."

center,"In Spain, emergency staff have been placed on standby to deal with a surge in heatstroke cases especially among vulnerable people, including children, the elderly and those with chronic illnesses.

""It always gets super hot in Madrid, what surprises me is how early it's happening - we're still in June,"" Marina, 22, told the Reuters news agency in the Spanish capital.

""This year is extreme. Last year, at least you could go out at this hour, but now? No way. It's intense, and people are drinking more water,"" Janeth, 47, said.

Italian authorities are advising residents in several cities, including Rome, Milan and Venice - where several A-list celebrities have gathered for the wedding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and TV presenter Lauren Sanchez - to stay indoors between 11:00 and 18:00 local time.

""There is no wind, a lot of humidity, we are sweating, and I'm suffocating at night,"" Alejandra Echeverria, a 40-year-old Mexican tourist in Venice, told AFP.

France, meanwhile, has been experiencing a heatwave for more than a week. Orange heat alerts, the country's second-highest warning, were issued for southern regions on Friday.

In the city of Marseille, municipal swimming pools are being opened free of charge until the end of the heatwave, while there have been calls in some places for schools to close to protect the health of students.

Yellow and amber alerts are also in place for parts of England this weekend, and temperatures in London may reach 35C on Monday. The heatwave is forecast to last until Tuesday evening.

Wildfires have already struck some parts of Europe, including Greece, where coastal towns near the capital Athens erupted in flames that destroyed homes - forcing people to evacuate.

While it is hard to link individual extreme weather events to climate change, heatwaves are becoming more common and more intense due to climate change.

Scientists at World Weather Attribution, who analyse the influence of climate change on extreme weather events, say June heatwaves with three consecutive days above 28C are about 10 times more likely to occur now compared to pre-industrial times."
center,"Among those laid to rest on Saturday was Mohammad Bagheri, the highest-ranking military officer in Iran who was chief of staff of Iran's armed forces.

Bagheri was to be buried with his wife and daughter, who were killed in an Israeli strike. In total, Iranian authorities said 627 people were killed in Iran. Israeli officials said 28 people were killed in Israel following missile attacks by Iran.

Hossein Salami, commander-in-chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, and nuclear scientists including Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi - head of Azad University in Tehran - were also among those laid to rest.

The funeral was attended by prominent figures including Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani - an advisor to the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - state television showed. Shamkhani was injured in an Israeli strike earlier this month.

It comes after US President Donald Trump said he would ""absolutely"" consider bombing Iran again.

Responding to a question from the BBC's Nomia Iqbal at a White House press briefing on Friday, he said he would ""without question"" attack the country if intelligence concluded Iran could enrich uranium to concerning levels.

Trump has also repeated his assertions that Iran was ""decimated"", writing: ""Why would the so-called 'Supreme Leader' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, of the war-torn country of Iran, say so blatantly and foolishly that he won the war with Israel, when he knows his statement is a lie.""

Trump also claimed to have known ""exactly where he [Khamenei] was sheltered"", saying he ""would not let Israel, or the US Armed Forces... terminate his life"".

""I saved him from a very ugly and ignominious death, and he does not have to say, 'thank-you, president Trump!'"", Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.

Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, warned Trump against making ""disrespectful"" comments about Khamenei, who claimed US and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites had achieved ""nothing significant"".

""If President Trump is genuine about wanting a deal, he should put aside the disrespectful and unacceptable tone towards Iran's Supreme Leader, Grand Ayatollah Khamenei,"" Araghchi posted on X.

""The Great and Powerful Iranian People, who showed the world that the Israeli regime had no choice but to run to 'Daddy' to avoid being flattened by our Missiles, do not take kindly to Threats and Insults.""

Araghchi has admitted that ""excessive and serious"" damage was done to Iran's nuclear sites by the recent bombings."

M&S has rolled out a limited-edition strawberries and cream sandwich, made with strawberries, whipped cream cheese and sweetened bread, which it says is inspired by the ""viral Japanese fruit sando"". The supermarket chain says it was its top-selling sandwich the two days after its launch.

Strawberry sandwiches are available at some Japanese bakeries in the UK, but M&S's offering appears to be the first time they have been widely available on supermarket shelves.

The idea of serving fruit in a sandwich might sound unusual but it's nothing new in Japan. Known as ""furutsu sando"", they became popular after Japanese fruit shops opened parlours selling desserts for customers to sample their wares.

They recently became sought-after around the world after going viral on social media, with Western tourists on TikTok scrambling to get their hands on the version sold in Japanese convenience store chain 7-Eleven."

CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported the White House had been considering a range of options to entice Iran back to the negotiating table, including facilitating funding for a civilian, non-enrichment, nuclear programme.

center,"America is a major market for Lotus but tariffs threaten its business, with US sellers required to pay taxes of 25% on imports of cars and car parts.

Figures released on Friday for the UK's car industry revealed exports to the US had halved as President Donald Trump's tariffs caused some car makers to halt shipments.

The UK government and Trump administration have agreed a deal to lower tariffs on UK-made cars entering the US to 10%, but it is not due to come into force until the end of June, meaning manufacturers have had to pay the higher rate to date.

Lotus is majority owned by the Chinese group Geely, which is in the process of reorganising its diverse portfolio of car brands, which also include Volvo, Polestar and Lynk and Co.

The company currently builds cars in Norfolk and in Wuhan, China.

Lotus was founded in the early 1950s by engineer Colin Chapman, moving to Norfolk in the 1960s.

In April, the carmaker announced 270 jobs would be cut ""amid volatile and evolving market conditions including the US tariffs"".

The decision followed previous job losses last year, but the company said it remained ""committed to the UK"" and that the restructuring was ""vital to enhance our competitiveness"".

President Trump has raised taxes on various goods entering the US in recent months in an attempt to encourage businesses and consumers to buy more American-made goods.

Car shipments to the US already incurred a 2.5% tariff, but now face higher rates.

However, if a deal with the US had not been reached, UK exports would have been taxed at 27.5%, as opposed to 10%. The lower tariff only applies to 100,000 British cars being imported to the US per year, which matches the number of vehicles the UK exported across the Atlantic last year."
center,"Canada's 3% digital services tax has been a sticking point in its relationship with the US since the law was enacted last year. The first payments are due on Monday.

Business groups estimate it will cost American companies, such as Amazon, Apple and Google, more than $2bn a year. Other countries have a similar tax in place, including the UK, France and Italy.

Canadian officials had said they expected to address the issue as part of trade talks with the US.

There were hopes that the relatively warm relationship that newly elected Carney has forged with Trump might help those negotiations.

The president's latest move casts doubt on a future deal, though Trump has often used social media threats to try to gain leverage in talks or speed up negotiations he sees as stalling.

Last month, for example, he threatened to ramp up tariffs on goods arriving to US shores from the European Union, only to relent a few days later.

Candace Laing, chief executive of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, which has been critical of the digital services tax, said that ""last-minute surprises should be expected"" as the deadline for a deal approaches.

""The tone and tenor of talks has improved in recent months, and we hope to see progress continue,"" she added.

Canadian Senator Hassan Yussuff, who sits on a Canada-US trade advisory council to Prime Minister Carney, told the Globe and Mail that he believes Trump is trying to gain ""leverage"" in the talks by putting pressure on Canada.

""I think we don't react to it,"" Yussuff said.

Meanwhile, some in Canada's business community have called on Carney to scrap the digital services tax. Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, said on Friday that the tax undermines Canada's relationship with the US, and it should be lifted ""to get trade negotiations back on track"".

At the G7 in mid-June, Trump and Carney had set a 30-day deadline for a trade deal to be reached. It is unclear whether Trump's latest comments have affected that timeline.

During Trump's first term, the White House fought hard as many countries began considering taxes on digital services.

But Inu Malak, fellow for trade policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted that the issue was left unresolved in the trade deal the US and the UK reached earlier this year, suggesting some flexibility.

She said Trump's threat seemed like a move to ramp up pressure out of his typical negotiating ""playbook - but was also a sign the president had refocused on Canada, which could open the way for a deal.

""It does provide a bit of an opening - maybe not the one that Prime Minister Carney wanted... but it does provide some space for them to hasten those talks,"" she said."

center,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates  — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he expects Iran to open itself to international inspection to verify that it doesn’t restart its nuclear program.

Asked during a White House news conference if he would demand during expected talks with Iran that the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, or some other organization be authorized to conduct inspections, Trump responded that the Islamic Republic would have to cooperate with the group “or somebody that we respect, including ourselves.”

Earlier, Iran’s top diplomat said that the possibility of new negotiations with the United States on his country’s nuclear program has been “complicated” by the American attack on three of the sites, which he conceded caused “serious damage.”

The U.S. was one of the parties to the 2015 nuclear deal in which Iran agreed to limits on its uranium enrichment program in exchange for sanctions relief and other benefits.

Nuclear talks

That deal unraveled after Trump unilaterally pulled out the U.S. during his first term. Trump has suggested he’s interested in new talks with Iran and said the two sides would meet next week.

In an interview on Iranian state television broadcast late Thursday, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi left open the possibility that his country would again enter talks on its nuclear program, but suggested it wouldn’t be anytime soon.

“No agreement has been made for resuming the negotiations,” he said. “No time has been set, no promise has been made, and we haven’t even talked about restarting the talks.”

The American decision to intervene militarily “made it more complicated and more difficult” for talks on Iran’s nuclear program, Araghchi said.

Many imams, during Friday prayers, stressed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s message from Thursday that the war had been a victory for Iran.

Cleric Hamzeh Khalili, who is also the deputy chief justice of Iran, vowed during a prayer service in Tehran that the courts would prosecute people accused of spying for Israel “in a special way.”

During the war with Israel, Iran hanged several people whom it already had in custody on espionage charges, sparking fears from activists that it could conduct a wave of executions after the conflict ended. Authorities reportedly have detained dozens in various cities on the charge of cooperating with Israel.

Israel relentlessly attacked Iran beginning on June 13, targeting its nuclear sites, defense systems, high-ranking military officials and atomic scientists.

In 12 days of strikes, Israel said that it killed around 30 Iranian commanders and 11 nuclear scientists, while hitting eight nuclear-related facilities and more than 720 military infrastructure sites. More than 1,000 people were killed, including at least 417 civilians, according to the Washington-based Human Rights Activists group.

Iran fired more than 550 ballistic missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted, but those that got through caused damage in many areas and killed 28 people.

Israeli military spokesperson Brig. Gen Effie Defrin said Friday that in some areas, it had exceeded its operational goals, but needed to remain vigilant.

“We are under no illusion, the enemy has not changed its intentions,” he said.

The U.S. stepped in on Sunday to hit three of Iran’s nuclear sites with bunker busters dropped by B-2 bombers — explosives designed to penetrate deep into the ground to damage the heavily fortified targets. Iran, in retaliation, fired missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar on Monday, but caused no known casualties.

Trump and Khamenei claims

Trump said that the American attacks “completely and fully obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program. However, Khamenei on Thursday accused the U.S. president of exaggerating the damage, saying the strikes didn’t “achieve anything significant.”

In response, Trump told reporters Friday that the sites were “bombed to hell.” He even directed a message to the supreme leader: “Look you’re a man of great faith. A man who’s highly respected in his country. You have to tell the truth. You got beat to hell.”

A senior Israeli military official said Friday that their intelligence shows that Israel’s strikes on various targets neutralized Iran’s ability to enrich uranium to 90% for “a prolonged period.” It was unclear whether that contradicted a preliminary U.S. report that suggested the program had been set back months.

There has been speculation that Iran moved much of its highly-enriched uranium before the strikes, something that it told the IAEA that it planned to do.

Even if that turns out to be true, IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi told Radio France International that the damage done to the Fordo site, which was built into a mountain, “is very, very, very considerable.”

Among other things, he said, centrifuges are “quite precise machines,” and it’s “not possible” that the concussion from multiple 30,000-pound bombs wouldn’t have caused “important physical damage.”

“These centrifuges are no longer operational,” he said.

Araghchi himself acknowledged “the level of damage is high, and it’s serious damage.”

He added that Iran hadn’t yet decided whether to allow in IAEA inspectors to assess the damage, but they would be kept out “for the time being.”"

center,"The son of Norway's crown princess is suspected of three rapes and 23 other offences, police said on Friday.

Marius Borg Høiby, who is the stepson of Norway's future king, was arrested three separate times last year, in August, September and November.

After a 10-month investigation, Norwegian police have now handed the case over to prosecutors who will decide whether to press charges, police attorney Andreas Kruszewski said.

Høiby's lawyer Petar Sekulic said his client was ""taking the accusations very seriously, but doesn't acknowledge any wrongdoing in most of the cases - especially the cases regarding sexual abuse and violence""."
center,"Details of the charges are not yet clear but local media say Gen Khumalo and the other six had been linked to an ongoing investigation into alleged abuse of intelligence funds and potentially unlawful appointments within the South African Police Service (SAPS).

It marks the second wave of arrests within two weeks targeting the SAPS' Crime Intelligence unit.

Three other top officials are facing corruption and other charges.

The arrests have raised questions about the integrity of the unit, which is meant to be actively preventing crime and cracking down on criminals.

The Democratic Alliance, the second-biggest party in the coalition government, welcomed the arrests, saying it was a right ""step in rescuing an organisation on the brink of collapse"".

""This points to yet another serious breach of trust within a critical state institution tasked with performing our nation's policing functions and mandate,"" the party said in a statement, external.

The Economic Freedom Fighters party said the arrest of Gen Khumalo was not an isolated scandal, external, but the ""latest symptom of a sick, and hollowed-out policing system, which urgently requires structural overhaul"".

Gen Khumalo became the head of the Crime Intelligence unit in 2022.

Up until then, he had served in different police units for more than two decades.

Numerous corruption cases against senior police officers over the years have tainted their reputation in the country."
center,"Flanked by Vice-President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and delegates from DR Congo and Rwanda in the Oval Office, Trump called the peace treaty ""a glorious triumph"".

""This is a tremendous breakthrough,"" Trump said, shortly before adding his signature to the peace treaty signed earlier by the respective African delegates.

The deal was signed by the Congolese and Rwandan foreign ministers at the US State Department.

""Another diplomatic success for President Félix Tshisekedi - certainly the most important in over 30 years,"" said the Congolese president's office, ahead of the signing.

There has been talk of Tshisekedi and Rwanda's President Paul Kagame going to Washington to meet Trump together, though no date has been fixed.

When tensions between the two countries escalated at the beginning of this year, Qatar intensified de-escalation efforts, according to a diplomat briefed on the negotiations.

Qatar sent envoys to both capitals to urge de-escalation, and after the Congolese and Rwandan presidents met in Doha, a joint committee was established, supported by the US, the diplomat added.

Decades of conflict escalated earlier this year when M23 rebels seized control of large parts of eastern DR Congo including the regional capital, Goma, the city of Bukavu and two airports.

Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands of civilians forced from their homes following the recent rebel offensive.

After the loss of territory, the government in Kinshasa turned to the US for help, reportedly offering access to critical minerals in exchange for security guarantees. Eastern DR Congo is rich in coltan and other resources vital to the global electronics industries.

Rwanda denies supporting the M23 despite overwhelming evidence, and insists its military presence in the region is a defensive measure against threats posed by armed groups like the FDLR - a rebel militia composed largely of ethnic Hutus linked to the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

Rwanda in turn accuses the Congolese government of backing the FDLR, which is denied by DR Congo. Their presence is of utmost concern to Kigali.

When some information about the deal was released last week, external, a statement spoke of ""provisions on respect for territorial integrity and a prohibition of hostilities"", but there were no specifics.

It also talked about the ""facilitation of the return of refugees and internally displaced persons"".

According to a Reuters news agency report, Congolese negotiators had pushed for an immediate withdrawal of Rwandan soldiers, external, but Rwanda - which has at least 7,000 troops on Congolese soil - refused, external.

In an angry statement a day before the deal was signed, Rwanda's Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe condemned ""the leak of a draft peace agreement"" saying Rwanda had ""demanded the other parties to respect the confidentiality of the discussions"", external.

The calls for the total withdrawal of Rwandan troops from DR Congo are a major point of contention.

But Nduhungirehe said ""the words 'Rwanda Defense Force', 'Rwandan troops' or 'withdrawal' are nowhere to be seen in the document"".

Just hours before the signing ceremony, Tshisekedi's office said the agreement ""does indeed provide for the withdrawal of Rwandan troops... [but] preferred the term disengagement to withdrawal simply because 'disengagement' is more comprehensive"".

Unless and until full details of the signed deal are made public, several crucial questions remain unanswered:

Will the M23 rebel group withdraw from areas they have occupied?

Does ""respect for territorial integrity"" mean Rwanda admits having troops in eastern DR Congo and will withdraw them?

Would the agreed ""return of refugees"" allow thousands of Congolese back from Rwanda?

Does ""disarmament"" mean that the M23 will now lay down their weapons?

Who will disarm the FDLR, after the failure of several previous attempts?

Would the agreed humanitarian access allow the reopening of the rebel-held airports for aid supply?

Prior to Friday's signing, Rwandan government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo told Reuters news agency that the ""lifting of defensive measures in our border area"" would be contingent upon the FDLR's ""neutralisation"".

One of the main actors in today's conflict - the M23 rebels - were spawned by a previous peace deal 16 years ago that failed to ensure demobilisation.

Last year, Rwandan and Congolese experts reached an agreement twice under Angolan mediation on the withdrawal of Rwandan troops and joint operations against the FDLR - but ministers from both countries failed to endorse the deal. Angola eventually stepped down as a mediator in March."

A united conservative majority of the Supreme Court ruled Friday that federal judges lack the authority to grant nationwide injunctions, but the decision left unclear whether President Donald Trump’s restrictions on birthright citizenship could soon take effect in parts of the country.

The outcome represented a victory for Trump, who has complained about judges throwing up obstacles to his agenda. Nationwide, or universal, injunctions had emerged as an important check on the Republican president’s efforts to expand executive power and remake the government and a source of mounting frustration to him and his allies.

But the court left open the possibility that the birthright citizenship changes could remain blocked nationwide. Trump’s order would deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of people who are in the country illegally or temporarily.

The cases now return to lower courts, where judges will have to decide how to tailor their orders to comply with the high court ruling, which was written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Enforcement of the policy can’t take place for another 30 days, Barrett wrote.

AP AUDIO: Supreme Court limits nationwide injunctions, but fate of Trump birthright citizenship order unclear AP correspondent Ed Donahue reports President Trump is thanking the Supreme Court for a ruling on nationwide injunctions.

Even then it’s unclear whether the court’s decision could produce a confusing patchwork of rules that might differ in the 22 states that sued over the Trump order and the rest of the country.

The justices agreed with the Trump administration, as well as President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration before it, that judges are overreaching by issuing orders that apply to everyone instead of just the parties before the court. Judges have issued more than 40 such orders since Trump took office for a second term in January.

The administration has filed emergency appeals with the justices of many of those orders, including the ones on birthright citizenship. The court rarely hears arguments and issues major decisions on its emergency, or shadow, docket, but it did so in this case.

Federal courts, Barrett wrote, “do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch; they resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given them. When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too.”

The president, speaking in the White House briefing room, said that the decision was “amazing” and a “monumental victory for the Constitution,” the separation of powers and the rule of law.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York wrote on X that the decision is “an unprecedented and terrifying step toward authoritarianism, a grave danger to our democracy, and a predictable move from this extremist MAGA court.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing in dissent for the three liberal justices, called the decision “nothing less than an open invitation for the government to bypass the Constitution.” This is so, Sotomayor said, because the administration may be able to enforce a policy even when it has been challenged and found to be unconstitutional by a lower court.

The administration didn’t even ask, as it has in other cases, for the lower-court rulings to be blocked completely, Sotomayor wrote. “To get such relief, the government would have to show that the order is likely constitutional, an impossible task,” she wrote.

But the ultimate fate of the changes Trump wants to make were not before the court, Barrett wrote, just the rules that would apply as the court cases continue.

Rights groups that sued over the policy filed new court documents following the high court ruling, taking up a suggestion from Justice Brett Kavanaugh that judges still may be able to reach anyone potentially affected by the birthright citizenship order by declaring them part of “putative nationwide class.” Kavanaugh was part of the court majority on Friday but wrote a separate concurring opinion.

States that also challenged the policy in court said they would try to show that the only way to effectively protect their interests was through a nationwide hold.

“We have every expectation we absolutely will be successful in keeping the 14th Amendment as the law of the land and of course birthright citizenship as well,” said Attorney General Andrea Campbell of Massachusetts.

Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers in the country illegally. The right was enshrined soon after the Civil War in the Constitution’s 14th Amendment.

In a notable Supreme Court decision from 1898, United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the court held that the only children who did not automatically receive U.S. citizenship upon being born on U.S. soil were the children of diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in the U.S. during hostile occupation; those born on foreign ships; and those born to members of sovereign Native American tribes.

The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli or “right of the soil” — is applied. Most are in the Americas, and Canada and Mexico are among them.

Trump and his supporters have argued that there should be tougher standards for becoming an American citizen, which he called “a priceless and profound gift” in the executive order he signed on his first day in office.

The Trump administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States, a phrase used in the amendment, and therefore are not entitled to citizenship.

But states, immigrants and rights groups that have sued to block the executive order have accused the administration of trying to unsettle the broader understanding of birthright citizenship that has been accepted since the amendment’s adoption.

Judges have uniformly ruled against the administration.

The Justice Department had argued that individual judges lack the power to give nationwide effect to their rulings.

The Trump administration instead wanted the justices to allow Trump’s plan to go into effect for everyone except the handful of people and groups that sued. Failing that, the administration argued that the plan could remain blocked for now in the 22 states that sued. New Hampshire is covered by a separate order that is not at issue in this case.

The justices also agreed that the administration may make public announcements about how it plans to carry out the policy if it eventually is allowed to take effect.

center,"The ruling allowed the preliminary relief, arguing the parents showed their case is likely to succeed on its merits, they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in its absence and that an injunction would be in the public interest.

The three liberal justices dissented.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissenting opinion that the result of the case will be ""chaos for this nation's public schools"".

""Given the great diversity of religious beliefs in this country, countless interactions that occur every day in public schools might expose children to messages that conflict with a parents' beliefs,"" she added.

The parents involved represent several different faiths, but all oppose their children being introduced to LGBTQ themes.

The US Constitution's First Amendment protects the right to freely exercise one's religious beliefs, which the parents argued includes the right to pull their children out of lessons they find offensive.

They also pointed to school rules that allow parents to opt older children out of sex education.

The books include Uncle Bobby's Wedding, which tells the story of a girl being told about her uncle's planned gay wedding, and Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope, about a transgender boy.

The parents argued they have no objection to the books being on the shelf or available in the library.

Montgomery County Public Schools, Maryland's largest school system, added the books in an effort to provide greater diversity in the stories children read. In 2023, it removed the opt-out option because it caused classroom disruption and could expose LGBTQ students to social stigma and isolation.

In a statement on Friday, Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said the ""ruling not only tells LGBTQ+ students that they don't belong, but that their experiences and existence are less worthy of respect"".

Eric Baxter, the attorney representing the group of parents, said the court's ruling was ""a win-win situation for parents everywhere"".

At a hearing for the case earlier this year, the justices appeared split along ideological lines. The court's conservative majority expressed sympathy for the group's argument."

center,"ARLINGTON, Va.  — They are a day away from becoming Catholic priests, rehearsing for their ordination Mass under the gothic cathedral’s arches.

It’s a balmy Friday afternoon in June, and they are practicing where to stand, when to kneel. The weekend’s rituals will be the culmination of six years of seminary and a lifetime of discernment.

There are so many of them — more than their diocese has ordained at one time in nearly 30 years — that it’s a challenge to fit the whole group in front of the altar.

Their bishop likes to call them “the 12.” Like the 12 apostles of Jesus, their number has become a mantra and a prayer. It offers hope there can still be joy and renewal in a church riven by division, crises and abuse.

Among the group there are engineers, a tech company founder and two future military chaplains. They range in age from 28 to 56. Most are U.S.-born, but some trace their roots to faraway countries with a strong Catholic presence: Cameroon, Mexico, Peru, Haiti.

They are entering the priesthood at an exciting time, just as the first U.S.-born pope begins his papacy. Yet, there remains an acute shortage of clergy like them. In the U.S., the number of priests has declined by more than 40% since 1970, according to CARA, a research center affiliated with Georgetown University.

During their final year of seminary, these 12 men have served as transitional deacons, offering baptisms, homilies and promising to live in obedience and celibacy. “We’ve already made the promises that are, I guess, ‘the scariest,’” said the Rev. Ricky Malebranche, one of the ordinands.

Soon they will be entrusted with more sacraments. As ordained priests, they will work at parishes around northern Virginia, with the ability to consecrate the Eucharist, hear confessions and anoint the sick.

For now, they shuffle side to side until they can fit in a row. Carefully they lie down to practice the act of prostration — arguably the most dramatic moment during an ordination ceremony. Elbows bent, hands cradling their heads, the men press their faces to the cold, marble floor.

It’s a position of vulnerability that signals absolute surrender.

“We’re laying before the Lord,” the Rev. Mike Sampson, an ordinand, explained before the rehearsal. “We’re laying our lives down.”

Searching for something more

While neighboring dioceses have shuttered parishes and face dire budget shortfalls, the Diocese of Arlington is opening new churches. Its finances are solid.

This year’s class of new priests is the second largest in the diocese’s 50-year history. The reasons behind that success “are a little bit mysterious,” said the Rev. Michael Isenberg, the diocese’s outgoing vocations director.

He points to one factor helping the recruiting pool: vibrant parishes, full of young professionals drawn to jobs around Washington, D.C.

Sampson, 42, was a government lawyer and raised a Protestant before he was baptized as a Catholic in 2013. Six years later, he enrolled in seminary to become a priest.

The Rev. Tim Banach, 31, worked as a consultant in the same office complex as Sampson. “I enjoyed the work I was doing, but there was something more that I desired.”

“I had the dream job,” said the Rev. Alfredo Tuesta, 40, who earned a doctorate in engineering and was working at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory when he felt called to the priesthood. “I had the job that I had trained many years to achieve — and it wasn’t enough.”

“I had the job that I had trained many years to achieve — and it wasn’t enough.” The Rev. Alfredo Tuesta, a newly ordained priest.

At a Sunday family dinner two weeks before ordination, Malebranche’s father, Jacques, talked up these “12 great guys.”

“This kid already had two master’s degrees,” he said, pointing to his son Ricky, 37, who worked as a counselor and coach at a Catholic high school before seminary.

The Diocese of Arlington, Virginia, recently ordained 12 new Catholic priests. The large class offers hope for the U.S. Catholic Church, which has suffered from division, abuse and a shortage of incoming clergy.

“They had good lives. When they say they received a call, they mean it,” he said. “They gave up a lot, and this is not easy.”

A higher barrier to entry

Prospective priests undergo a rigorous screening process.

“This is going to sound crazy, but they’re normal,” said the Rev. Donald J. Planty Jr., who mentored several of this year’s ordinands. “They can talk to anyone.”

In the wake of the clergy sex-abuse crisis, there is a greater emphasis on applicants’ psychological health and emotional well-being. They go before an admissions board that includes women and laypeople, and as ordinands, meet with abuse survivors.

They ultimately answer to Bishop Michael Burbidge, the diocese’s avuncular prelate.

“A thing that has changed for the positive in the church is that bishops really know their men,” said Burbidge, who calls, texts and meets with seminarians regularly. “When I was in seminary, there was no expectation that you would know the bishop.”

Politically and theologically, young U.S. priests are more likely to identify as conservative or moderate than their clerical elders who came of age in the 1960s and 1970s, according to a 2023 report from the Catholic Project at Catholic University.

For these men in Virginia, the rightward tilt of the U.S. Catholic Church is not a deciding factor in their priesthoods. They have pledged, though, to uphold the church’s teachings, which remain conservative on issues such as gender identity, sexual orientation, contraception and abortion.

“I look at the young adults in our parishes, growing up in a world where in many ways the sacred has been removed,” Burbidge said. “They’re looking for something more. ‘Give me beauty. Give me truth. Give me clarity.’ I see that in young adults in our church, and these men are products of that.”

The sacrifices of priestly life

For many of the men, priesthood means forgoing dreams of an ordinary family life.

“I thought I was going to be a great dad and have a wonderful family,” Malebranche recalled. “And I was like, ‘Lord, why would you not want that for me?’”

For many, there’s a grieving process in letting go of that vision, even for deeply Catholic families.

“Every parent wants grandkids,” said Banach, whose career change initially surprised his supportive Catholic parents. Priests give up biological children, he said, but are privileged to raise “spiritual children.”

His fellow ordinand Malebranche ministers to families out of what he calls a “deep love of my own for a family.”

Two weeks before ordination, Malebranche channeled that love into a baptism conducted in Spanish, the parents’ native tongue.

He was nervous beforehand. A gregarious, gifted speaker, he is less confident in Spanish — though it’s necessary in a diocese where nearly half the parishioners are Latino.

“It was a beautiful ceremony,” Gloria Marquez told him after, beaming and holding her 9-month-old. She said she and her husband had tried for nearly 20 years to have a baby.

Malebranche teared up, grateful to be part of the longed-for moment.

He wants the Catholic Church to be welcoming, especially for those who have been hurt. “I really just want to make Catholicism warm,” he said.

Like all the ordinands, he is very aware that in his clerical garb, he represents the church and the presence of Jesus.

“I have to be on every time I’m in this collar,” Malebranche said. “That is a fitting weight for the gift of the priesthood, but it is a weight nonetheless.”

A new chapter

Ordination-day morning had the nervous energy of a wedding, an apt parallel for the impending commitment and pageantry. Anxious parents took their places in pews alongside friends and family who traveled from around the world to witness the ceremony.

The evening would bring receptions in honor of the new priests, who would then have two weeks off before their new ministry assignments began.

Sampson was going to Italy with a priest friend. Banach was hiking part of the Appalachian Trail with a small kit for the Eucharist in his pack. Tuesta was flying to Lima, Peru, his birthplace, to celebrate with family.

Malebranche planned to visit loved ones in his native Virginia. “I’m kind of looking to show off,” he said, laughing. “I’ll have my confessional stole on me at all times.”

When their ordination Mass got underway, it was standing room only, with more than 1,200 well-wishers crowded into the cathedral.

As part of the three-hour service, nearly 200 priests lined up to embrace and welcome into the fold their new brothers, now cloaked in ivory and blue robes.

At the close of Mass, they walked down the aisle to cheers and applause, and the 12 priests were sent out, like the apostles who had come before them.

Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu

Reporting from Washington DC

For weeks, we have been waiting for one of the most important Supreme Court decisions of the current term.

On the last day before the court paused for the summer, the opinion appeared.

In a 6-3 decision, the conservative majority curbed the powers of lower court judges to block President Donald Trump's orders nationwide.

At the White House, Trump called the ruling a ""monumental victory for the constitution"".

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, from the liberal wing of the court, wrote the dissenting opinion. Sotomayor described it as an ""open invitation for the government to bypass the Constitution"".

The case stems from President Trump's order to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants. The court's ruling did not directly tackle the constitutionality of Trump's order, and it will likely to end up before the top court at a later date.

We are pausing our live coverage, but you can read more analysis on the impact of today's ruling for Trump's power here."

At town hall after town hall across Pennsylvania, Democrats and allied progressive groups aren’t hearing from Fetterman in person — or Republicans who control Washington, for that matter.

But they are hearing from Lamb, a living reminder of the Democrat they could have elected instead of Fetterman. The former congressman has emerged as an in-demand town hall headliner, sometimes as a stand-in for Fetterman — who just might bash Fetterman.

“I thought I was going to play Senator Fetterman,” Lamb joked as he sat down in front of a central Pennsylvania crowd last Sunday.

Democrats are frustrated with Fetterman

Lamb’s reemergence comes at an in-between moment, roughly halfway through Fetterman’s six-year term, and is helping define the struggle facing Democrats in swing-state Pennsylvania.

There, Democrats figure prominently in their national effort to push back on President Donald Trump, but also in their struggle to figure out what to do about Fetterman, who is under fire from rank-and-file Democrats for being willing to cooperate with Trump and criticizing how Democrats have protested him.

Frustration with Fetterman has been on display on social media, at the massive “ No Kings ” rally in Philadelphia and among the Democratic Party’s faithful. The steering committee of the progressive organization Indivisible PA last month asked Fetterman to resign.

It’s quite a turnabout for the hoodies-and-shorts-wearing Fetterman, elected in 2022 with an everyman persona and irreverent wit, who was unafraid to challenge convention.

For some progressives, frustration with Fetterman began with his staunch support for Israel’s punishing war against Hamas in Gaza, an issue that divides Democrats.

It’s moved beyond that since Trump took office. Now, some are wondering why he’s — as they see it — kissing up to Trump, why he’s chastising fellow Democrats for their anti-Trump resistance and whether he’s even committed to their causes at all.

Most recently, they question his support for Trump’s bombing of Iran.

“It hurts,” said John Abbott, who attended Sunday’s event in suburban Harrisburg.

Speaking at the flagship “No Kings” rally in Philadelphia, Indivisible co-founder Leah Greenberg name-checked Fetterman.

“We’re looking to the leaders who will fight for us, because even today there are folks among the Democratic Party who think we should roll over and play dead,” Greenberg said. “Anyone seen John Fetterman here today?”

The crowd booed.

Why is Conor Lamb crisscrossing Pennsylvania again?

In Pittsburgh, progressives trying to land an in-person town hall with Fetterman or first-term Republican Sen. David McCormick noticed when the two senators advertised an event together at a downtown restaurant to celebrate the release of McCormick’s new book.

Progressive groups organized to protest it and — after it got moved to a private location with a private invite list — went ahead with their own town hall. They invited Lamb and a local Democratic state representative instead.

More invitations for Lamb started rolling in.

By his count, he’s now attended at least a dozen town halls and party events, easily clocking more than 2,000 miles to appear in small towns, small cities and suburbs, often in conservative areas.

“Showing up matters and it really does make a difference,” said Dana Kellerman, a Pittsburgh-based progressive organizer. “Is that going to matter to John Fetterman? I really don’t know. I don’t know what he’s thinking. I don’t know if he’s always been this person or if he’s changed in the last two years.”

Fetterman has brushed off criticism, saying he’s a committed Democrat, insisting he was elected to engage with Republicans and — perhaps hypocritically — questioning why Democrats would criticize fellow Democrats.

At times, Fetterman has criticized Trump, questioning the move to “punch our allies in the mouth” with tariffs or the need for cuts to social-safety net programs in the GOP’s legislation to extend 2017’s tax cuts. Fetterman’s office didn’t respond to an inquiry about Lamb.

For his part, Lamb — a former U.S. Marine and federal prosecutor — says he isn’t running for anything right now, but he’ll do whatever he can to “stop this slide that we’re on toward a less democratic country and try to create one in which there’s more opportunity for people.”

To some Democrats, he sounds like a candidate.

“That he’s doing these town halls is a good indication that he’ll be running for something, so it’s a good thing,” said Janet Bargh, who attended the event in suburban Harrisburg.

Aside from the town halls, he spoke at the Unite for Veterans event on the National Mall. He has also been active on social media, doing local radio appearances and appearing on MSNBC, where he recently criticized the June 14 military parade ordered up by Trump.

Not long ago, it was hard to envision Lamb losing a race, ever.

In 2018, he won a heavily Trump-friendly congressional district in southwestern Pennsylvania in a special election. It was the center of the political universe that spring, drawing campaign visits by Trump and then-presidential hopeful Joe Biden.

Suddenly, Lamb was ascendant. Then he ran for Senate and lost handily — by more than two-to-one — to Fetterman in 2022’s primary.

People often ask Lamb if he’s going to challenge Fetterman again. Lamb said he reminds them that Fetterman has three years left in his term and pivots the conversation to what Democrats need to do to win elections in 2025 and 2026.

Still, Lamb is unafraid to criticize Fetterman publicly. And, he said, he’s a magnet for Democrats to air their unhappiness with Fetterman. What he hears, over and over, is frustration that Fetterman spends too much time attacking fellow Democrats and not enough time challenging Trump.

“And that is, I think, what’s driving the frustration more than any one particular issue,” Lamb said.

At the town hall, Lamb wasn’t afraid to admit he’d lost to Fetterman. But he turned it into an attack line.

“When I watch the person who beat me give up on every important issue that he campaigned on ... the more I reasoned that the point of all of this in the first place is advocacy for what’s right and wrong,” Lamb told the crowd. “And advocacy for not just a particular party to win, but for the type of country where it matters if, when you stand up, you tell the truth.”

The crowd cheered."
center,"The supreme leader, who has been in hiding since the war with Israel began on 13 June, insisted that Trump had ""exaggerated"" the impact of the bombs, and declared victory over the US and Israel.

But Araghchi's remarks create a different impression.

The foreign minister also said there were no plans to resume nuclear talks with the US. Iran cancelled a scheduled sixth round of talks when Israel began its attacks.

""I would like to state clearly that no agreement, arrangement or conversation has been made to start new negotiations,"" he said.

He added that the government was examining what was in the ""interest of the Iranian people"", saying its approach to diplomacy will take a ""new form"".

He did not explain what he meant.

In an attempt to bring Iran back to the negotiating table, the Trump administration has discussed the possibility of helping Iran access $30bn to build a civilian-energy-producing nuclear programme, easing sanctions and freeing up billions of dollars in restricted Iranian funds, CNN has reported.

But developments in Iran might obstruct such a move.

On Wednesday, Iran's parliament approved a bill to stop co-operation with the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). If it is implemented, it would mean Iran is no longer committed to allowing nuclear inspectors into its sites.

Israel has said its offensive against Iran was necessary to thwart what it claims are Iranian plans to develop nuclear weapons.

Iran has always insisted its nuclear programme is only intended for civilian purposes.

The US became directly involved in the conflict last weekend, striking facilities in Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, before Trump sought to rapidly mediate a ceasefire between Israel and Iran."

An amber alert covers the East Midlands, south-east, south-west, east and London - meaning various health services and the whole population could be affected by the heat, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

In Yorkshire and the Humber, as well as the West Midlands, less serious yellow alerts apply, meaning that the elderly and vulnerable could be affected.

Temperatures are forecast to rise into the 30s over the weekend, coinciding with Glastonbury Festival, before reaching a new high for the year on Monday, when the Wimbledon tennis championship begins."
center,"Labour's original plan to reform the welfare system was a hasty effort to try to make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the chancellor meet her self-imposed rules on government borrowing.

But this latest U-turn raises significant questions about just how stability and credibility-enhancing it really is to tweak financial plans every six months to hit budget targets that change frequently due to a variety of reasons, including things such as the cost of borrowing which the government cannot control.

The latest deal suggests the welfare reforms will only save £2bn a year rather than the £5bn they were expected to save by 29-30.

The planned cut to disability personal independent payment (Pip) eligibility was set to raise the bulk of this saving, £4.5bn.

But now the changes will apply only to new claimants from November 2026, sparing 370,000 current claimants out of the 800,000 identified by the DWP impact assessment.

Another change announced in March, which now only applies to new claimants, involves how Pip applicants are assessed.

Pip assessments involve questions about tasks like preparing and eating food, washing and getting dressed. Each is scored from zero - for no difficulty - to 12 - for the most severe.

For example, needing help to wash your hair, or your body below the waist, would be awarded two points, but needing help to wash between the shoulders and waist would equate to four points.

Under the new system people will need to score at least four points for one activity, instead of qualifying for support across a broad range of tasks.

Rebel leader Meg Hillier and ministers have jointly stressed that the new four-point threshold will be a so-called ""co-production"".

This means they will be drawn up together with disability charities, so how the scoring will be applied is still unclear and suggests the changes may not save as much money as expected."

center,"Palestine Action said its activists were able to evade security and claimed they had put two air-to-air refuelling tankers ""out of service"".

The group said activists used repurposed fire extinguishers to spray the paint and caused ""further damage"" using crowbars.

However, Downing Street said the incident had not blocked any planned aircraft movements or stopped any operations.

The base is encircled by a large perimeter fence, with security cameras and sensors in the area in addition to manned security checkpoints. Patrols around the base are also carried out from time to time.

But a defence source said these measures would not have been able to provide complete cover around the large airbase.

Defence Secretary John Healey said he was ""really disturbed"" by the incident and ordered a wider security review of all UK military bases.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned the break-in as ""disgraceful"", characterising it as an ""act of vandalism"".

RAF Brize Norton serves as the hub for UK strategic air transport and refuelling, including flights to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus.

The air force has conducted reconnaissance flights over Gaza out of the Cyprus base, though the Ministry of Defence told the BBC that RAF Voyager aircraft had not been involved in refuelling or supporting Israeli Air Force jets.

A Palestine Action spokesperson said in a statement shortly after the break-in: ""Despite publicly condemning the Israeli government, Britain continues to send military cargo, fly spy planes over Gaza and refuel US and Israeli fighter jets.""

Police said the incident took place in the early hours of 20 June and that ""damage was caused to two aircraft""."

""I couldn't sing this song two years ago. I might struggle to finish it today for different reasons,"" he said, tearing up again.

""My name is Lewis Capaldi and I'm [expletive] back, baby.""

The star's entire set was a back and forth with the audience, as Capaldi alternated lines with fans who'd shown up to give him their love.

It was one of the most moving and heart-warming spectacles I've ever witnessed at Glastonbury, or anywhere else, for that matter.

Capaldi, who has Tourette's, last performed at the festival in 2023 under difficult and emotional circumstances.

In front of thousands, he lost his voice and experienced pronounced tics. The audience ultimately stepped in to help him finish his final song, Someone You Loved, in a gesture of affection, solidarity and support.

""Glastonbury, I'm really sorry,"" the singer said as that set drew to a close. ""I'm a bit annoyed with myself.""

A few days later, he announced he was retreating from the spotlight to get his ""physical and mental health in order"" and ""adjust to the impact"" of his Tourette's diagnosis. He has only made limited public appearances since.

Addressing those experiences on Friday, he said: ""It's just a short set today but I just wanted to come and finish what I couldn't finish first time around.

""Second time's a charm on this one, everybody.""

The audience showed its support by chanting his name to the tune of The White Stripes' Seven Nation Army."

center,"In the four weeks since the launch of a controversial US- and Israeli-backed aid system in Gaza, there have been repeated incidents of killings and injuries of Palestinians seeking aid.

According to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, in the past month more than 500 people on their way to get aid have been killed and 4,000 injured.

To get a clearer understanding of how the last month has unfolded, BBC Verify has analysed dozens of videos from across Gaza that offer an insight into what this aid system looked like on the ground. Footage shows a near-daily cycle of chaos, panic, live gunfire and dead or injured Palestinians.

While the videos show an overall picture of danger and chaos, they do not definitively show who is responsible for firing in each incident. However in many cases, eyewitnesses and medics have described Israeli forces opening fire on crowds near aid sites.

In statements over the past month, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have several times said they fired ""warning shots"" at individuals who they described as ""suspects"" or said posed a threat.

The IDF has told BBC Verify that Hamas does ""everything in its power to prevent the success of food distribution in Gaza, tries to disrupt aid, and directly harms the citizens of the Gaza Strip"".

On 18 May Israel announced it was partially easing its 11-week long blockade of aid into Gaza, which it had said was aimed at putting pressure on Hamas to release hostages.

The IDF built four aid distribution sites - three in the far south-west of Gaza and one in central Gaza by an Israel security zone known as the Netzarim Corridor - which began operations on 26 May.

These sites in IDF-controlled areas - known as SDS 1, 2, 3 and 4 - are operated by security contractors working for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), with the Israeli military securing the routes to them and the perimeters. On Thursday the US State Department announced $30m (£22m; €26m) in funding for the GHF - the first known direct contribution to the group.

From the start the UN condemned the plan, saying it would ""militarise"" aid, bypass the existing distribution network and force Gazans to make long journeys through dangerous territory to get food.

Within days of the plan starting, dozens of Palestinians were killed in separate incidents on 1 and 3 June, sparking international condemnation. Since then there have been near-daily reports of killings of people travelling to collect aid."

""Between mid-July and August 2024, he was in contact with a young adult from Austria who was planning a bomb attack on a concert by singer Taylor Swift in Vienna.""

Sixty-five thousand fans had bought tickets for Swift's three concerts on 8-10 August, and the singer later apologised for the cancellation, speaking of the ""tremendous amount of guilt"" she felt. She said she had decided to throw all her energy into the shows at the end of her European tour in London.

The main suspect in the case has been identified as Beran A, who authorities say was part of an IS cell in eastern Austria.

Beran A, who is now 20 and from Ternitz south of Vienna, was arrested before the concerts following a tip-off by the CIA, which said the plotters had hoped to kill a large number of concert-goers.

Investigators allege he had also planned to carry out an earlier attack in Dubai in March 2024.

Reports suggested it was part of a co-ordinated plot involving three simultaneous IS attacks but Beran A had changed his mind at the last minute.

According to the federal prosecutor in Germany, Mohammad A had helped the main suspect with a translation of bomb-making instructions from Arabic as well as making contact with a member of IS abroad over the internet.

He is also accused of providing the text for an oath of allegiance to the main suspect to join IS."

""I'm really disappointed. All I have is anger,"" said another member of the group, Teruko Yokoyama, in a Kyodo News report.

Survivors of the atomic bomb attacks staged a protest in Hiroshima on Thursday, demanding Trump retract his statement.

Lawmakers in Hiroshima also passed a resolution on Thursday rejecting statements that justify the use of atomic bombs, and called for armed conflicts to be settled peacefully.

Asked if Tokyo would lodge a complaint over Trump's remarks, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi Yoshimasa said that Japan has repeatedly expressed its position on atomic bombs to Washington.

Trump's comments on Wednesday came as he pushed back on a leaked intelligence report that said US strikes on Iran only set its nuclear programme back by a few months.

Trump had insisted that the strikes ""obliterated"" the programme and set it back ""decades"" - a claim backed by CIA director John Ratcliffe.

Japan is the only country in the world to have been hit by a nuclear attack and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki still stir painful memories.

In Hiroshima, a peace flame that symbolises the country's opposition to nuclear weapons has been burning since the 1960s while a clock that counts the number of days since the world's last nuclear attack is displayed at the entrance of a war museum.

center,"The particular aircraft model carries the two recorder sets to aid in thorough analysis. These combined units record flight data and cockpit audio.

Data recorders track with high precision the position of gear and flap levers, thrust settings, engine performance, fuel flow and even fire handle activation.

The data can be used to reconstruct the flight's final moments and determine the cause of the incident.

The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) captures pilot radio calls, individual mic audio, and ambient cockpit sounds via an area microphone.

The aviation ministry said data from the recorder was accessed on Wednesday by a team led by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), with the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

""The analysis of CVR and FDR [flight data recorder] data is underway. These efforts aim to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the accident and identify contributing factors to enhance aviation safety and prevent future occurrences,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Meanwhile, US National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy told Reuters news agency that she hopes the Indian government will be able to share details from the investigation into the crash in short order.

""For aviation safety and for public safety and public awareness we hope that they will make their findings public swiftly,"" Homendy said on the sidelines of an aviation event.

She said the NTSB team has been working diligently to provide assistance to India and ""we have had excellent cooperation from the Indian government and the AAIB.""

India's decision to download and investigate data from the flight recorders comes nearly two weeks after the crash and has raised questions among aviation experts, some of whom described the delay as unusual.

Air India Flight 171 was airborne for less than 40 seconds before it crashed into a crowded Ahmedabad neighbourhood, killing all but one of the 242 passengers on board, in one of India's most puzzling air disasters in recent memory.

But the other two are more straight forward U-turns: decisions of the government's own making they later concluded were deeply unpopular.

This latest one, on the welfare state, comes after Sir Keir Starmer has endured his bumpiest days yet in Downing Street.

He was publicly humiliated by coach-loads of his own MPs in a well-executed campaign while he was out of the country at the Nato summit in the Netherlands.

The scale of it, and its remorseless growth over the last 48 to 72 hours, nigh on guaranteed his eventual capitulation.

The alternative was defeat.

But this shouldn't have come as a surprise. Labour MPs have been telling myself and others for months they didn't like these plans - and more and more of them were making their views known both publicly and privately within the party.

The government was determined not to budge, perhaps hopeful much of it was noise and their mountainous majority would inoculate them from a minority of grumblers.

The prime minister is determined to leverage that majority to take on what he sees as the difficult changes the country desperately needs.

The benefits bill is rising fast and he, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves and others believe the only way to protect the welfare state and ensure it is sustainable into the long term is to at least limit the scale of its growth.

But the grumblers got louder, more numerous and more organised.

And Downing Street found out the hard way their plans were doomed.

By Thursday evening, multiple sources were telling me the concessions were agreed and were big, and the outline of the about-turn was spelt out.

But it was only formally confirmed at half past midnight on Friday morning.

In addition to the anger and uncertainty that this saga has caused for so many benefits recipients, there are two potentially long-lasting political consequences: for the Treasury's spreadsheets and the prime minister's authority.

Projecting economic competence and a firm grip of the public finances runs to the core of the image Reeves wants to project as chancellor. These cuts were, in part at least, about doing just that. But now all the numbers are changing.

And as for Sir Keir Starmer's authority, moments like this can leave a lasting impression, on a prime minister's own MPs and the country at large.

No 10 had rapidly concluded this about-turn was their least worst option.

The criminal investigation into the scandal, Operation Olympos, began in 2020, and interviewed two suspects in 2021.

Mersey and West Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust had more than 48,000 patients waiting less than 18 weeks so far for treatment, 64.2% of the total, in April. That is up from 58.7% in November.

East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust also reached 60.1% in April, up from 54.9% in November.

The biggest target for improvement was set for The Princess Alexandra Hospital Trust in Harlow, according to our analysis. In November, 41.8% of its patients were waiting less than 18 weeks. By April, that had risen to about 48.8% - one of the biggest improvements in England so far. But it needs to rise further by more than 11 percentage points by next March.

PAHT chief executive Thom Lafferty said they were ""delighted"" with their progress.

""We recognise the impact for patients who are waiting for care and we are enhancing integration and collaboration with our partners to ensure that patients can access the right care, in the right place, at the right time.""

Some trusts have a higher mountain to climb because their figures have dipped since November.

Mid and South Essex NHS Trust started out with 52.8% of patients waiting less than 18 weeks in November. But when the clock started in April, it had fallen to 47%.

Two of its theatres at Basildon Hospital have been closed for work along with some of the trust's procedure rooms and it has had an increase in referrals.

Chief executive Matthew Hopkins said it was putting on extra clinics and had a new orthopaedic procedure room opening soon, adding: ""We are confident we will improve our waiting times and improve patient experience.""

Others that have fallen despite requiring large improvements include the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital (RJAH) in Shropshire (down from 48.3% to 44.9%) and Countess of Chester, down from 49.6% to 47.1%.

Cathy Chadwick, chief operating officer for Countess of Chester, said more clinics and investment in new technology would bring down waiting lists and the trust was confident of meeting the target by next March.

center,"Kenya has been hit by a recent wave of repression, tarnishing its reputation as a beacon of democracy in East Africa.

Critics fear that it is sliding down the path of her neighbours - Uganda and Tanzania, both of which are notorious for cracking down on dissent.

Kenya's laws are widely regarded as being more progressive - particularly in protecting fundamental freedoms like the right to protest.

But Kenya has witnessed an increasing crackdown on protests - the latest example being the killing of at least 10 people in nationwide demonstrations against President William Ruto's government while it attempted to ban live TV and radio coverage of the protests.

""Rogue Regime"" - declared the headline of Kenya's respected Standard newspaper as it pointed out that young people had flooded the streets in defiant remembrance of those gunned down a year ago in mass anti-tax demonstrations but ""Instead of a listening ear they were met with razor wire, armoured trucks and the cold grip of repression"".

But as far as Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen is concerned, the police showed ""remarkable restraint"" as they foiled an ""attempted coup"".

""We condemn the criminal anarchists who in the name of peaceful demonstrations unleashed a wave of violence, looting, sexual assault and destruction upon our people,"" he said, accusing the protesters of attacking police stations and injuring 300 officers.

However, the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) condemned the police for their handling of the protest.

""The unnecessary aggression and brute force that culminated in the senseless loss of life and senseless destruction of property have no place in a free democratic society,"" it said.

The crackdown came just weeks after a 31-year-old blogger and teacher, Albert Ojwang, died in police custody. He was arrested after being accused of defaming a senior police officer - and died in detention of assault wounds, an autopsy found.

His death triggered a small protest in the capital, Nairobi, which police clamped down on and a street vendor, who was caught in the crossfire - shot at close-range, is fighting for his life in hospital.

The LSK denounced his shooting as unbefitting for ""any sane democracy"".

Its comment brought into sharp focus the fact that Kenya risks losing its status as a democracy that many Tanzanians and Ugandans envied – and drew inspiration from.

Tanzanian political analyst Nicodemus Minde said there had long been an ""appreciation"" among Tanzanians of the ability of Kenyans to ""speak truth to power"".

It was a view shared by Tanzania's main opposition leader Tundu Lissu who told the BBC last year that ""We have not pressed hard enough for democratic reform"".

""What Kenya did to build its democratic space is something we need to do,"" he said.

Having miraculously survived an assassination attempt after being shot 16 times in 2017, Lissu has become a symbol of state repression in Tanzania.

He is currently in detention, charged with treason for rallying his supporters under the slogan ""No reform; no elections"".

The government saw this as an attempt by Lissu to launch a rebellion – and he risks being sentenced to death if convicted.

The 57-year-old opposition leader sees his detention as an attempt by the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party – which has been in power since independence in 1961– to clear its path to victory in presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for October.

This perception has been strengthened by the fact that his Chadema party has been barred from contesting the poll after it refused to sign an electoral code of conduct that it believed would undermine its right to campaign freely.

The opposition in Uganda sees itself in a similar situation, pointing out that President Yoweri Museveni has been in power for almost 40 years, and – along with his son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who heads the army – is cracking down on political rivals in the build-up to elections in early 2026.

center,"While Dame Meg is now backing the bill, Nadia Whittome, Labour MP for Nottingham East, said she would still be voting against it unless disabled people received further protections - and that she would be ""far from the only one"".

""All of the MPs I've spoken to who signed the recent amendment - across the party, not just on the left - are sticking to their position because we understand that we're answerable to our constituents,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Asked several times on BBC Breakfast whether the row was over, Anna Dixon, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on carers and welfare cuts, said it was ""very difficult"" to say because the process had been ""all quite rushed"".

One of the rebels, Alex Sobel, the MP for Leeds Central and Headingley, also told BBC Newsnight he was concerned the changes could create a ""two-tier"" system - a concern echoed by other Labour backbenchers.

Tuesday's vote is the first opportunity for MPs to support or reject the bill.

The government could still face defeat if 83 Labour backbenchers, along with other opposition parties, attempt to block the bill.

If it clears this hurdle, it will then face a few hours' examination by all MPs the following week - rather than days or weeks in front of a committee.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves had factored savings from the cuts into her Spring Statement - designed to help meet her economic plans - but it is now unclear how the fresh changes will affect these.

Ruth Curtice, head of the Resolution Foundation, said the government's U-turn could cost up to £3bn.

Working-age health-related benefit spending has increased from £36bn to £52bn between 2019 and 2024, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank.

It is expected to double to £66bn by 2029 without changes to the system.

center,"Trump's post comes days after he rebuked Israel for attacking Iran after he had announced a ceasefire deal between the two following a 12-day exchange of missiles.

Netanyahu has repeatedly praised Trump's decision to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities on Sunday, calling it a ""bold"" move.

Posting on his Truth Social platform, Trump described his long-time ally as a ""great hero, who has done so much"" for Israel, and a ""warrior"".

He said Netanyahu's trial should be ""cancelled immediately"" or he should be given a pardon, adding that he learned Netanyahu was due to appear in court on Monday. Netanyahu has appeared in court multiple times since the trial started.

Trump described the case against Netanyahu as a ""witch hunt"" - a term he repeatedly used to describe investigations into his own alleged wrongdoing in the US, adding: ""This travesty of 'justice cannot be allowed!""

After Trump said there was ""no one that I know who could have worked in better harmony"" with him, Netanyahu said: ""We will continue to work together to defeat our common enemies, free our hostages, and quickly expand the circle of peace.""

But Yair Lapid suggested the attempted intervention might be part of a calculated move by Trump.

""I hope and suppose that this is a reward [Trump] is giving [Netanyahu] because he is planning to pressure him on Gaza and force, to force him into a hostage deal that will end the war,"" Yair Lapid told Israeli news website Ynet.

Netanyahu's trials have been taking place against the backdrop of the conflicts Israel has been engaged in since the deadly and unprecedented 7 October 2023 Hamas attack, leading to delays in the legal proceedings.

In particular, the length of the war against Hamas in Gaza has led to claims by some that Netanyahu wants to prolong the fighting to delay elections and the conclusion of his trials."

For people earning up to 1m naira ($650; £470) a year, a rent relief of 200,000 naira ($130) will be applied, effectively reducing their taxable income to 800,000 naira ($520). This means they will no longer pay income tax, according to Andersen Nigeria, a tax and business advisory firm.

Sellers of essential goods and services such as food, healthcare, education, rent, power, and baby products will no longer have to charge a Value Added Tax (VAT), helping families better afford their basic needs.

Small businesses with annual turnover below 50m naira ($32,400) will no longer pay company income tax. They will also be allowed to file simpler returns, without needing audited accounts.

Large businesses will benefit from reduced corporate tax rates, dropping from 30% to 27.5% in 2025 and 25% in subsequent years.

They will also now be able to claim tax credits for VAT paid on expenses and assets, meaning they can get back the 7.5% that would have been paid as VAT.

There are also tax incentives for charitable groups, co-operatives, educational and religious organisations, provided their earnings do not come from commercial activities."

There are concerns the US president could install someone who is sympathetic to his demands.

Earlier this week, Mr Powell told US lawmakers the Fed would wait and see how the American economy reacts if Trump's so-called retaliatory tariffs against a range of countries come into force next month, after being paused until 9 July.

The Fed is concerned that the levies, which are paid by the businesses importing the goods, might push up inflation.

The US economy shrank in the first three months of this year - the first decline for three years - as government spending fell and imports rose as firms raced to get products into the country before the tariffs went live.

JP Morgan, the investment bank, has lowered the chance of the US economy falling into recession this year but at 40% the probability of a slowdown remains comparatively high.

Kaspar Hense, a senior portfolio manager at RBC BlueBay Asset Management, said traders were betting the dollar would fall ""in this environment, where there is an erosion of institutions"".

While Kit Juckes, chief FX strategist at Societe Generale, said: ""I think the market is pricing in President Trump appointing someone who at least at first sight appears more sympathetic to his cause.""

Academics have said that confidence in the Fed's independence is key to maintaining financial markets' faith that inflation will be controlled.

When I was growing up, sleepovers were a rite of passage. Although sleepovers are now a controversial topic, I didn't want to deny my kids the same experiences I had.

I let them start having sleepovers as kindergartners, but we put one important non-negotiable rule in place.

I loved sleepovers growing up

Some of my fondest childhood memories involve shimmying into my sleeping bag, holding a flashlight, and laughing with my friends until our eyes became too heavy with happy exhaustion to keep them open any longer.

During these sleepovers, my friends and I watched movies, played games, and snuck snacks late into the night. Many of the rules my friends and I dutifully followed in our everyday lives vanished once the sun went down. Often, we had no bedtime, and junk food was no longer off-limits.

I loved sleepovers so much that I requested a slumber party to celebrate every birthday.

Once I became a parent, I looked forward to hosting sleepovers

As a parent, I looked forward to my children experiencing the same joy that sleepovers had brought me as a child. As kindergarteners, they already had strong friendships. I knew most of the parents of their close friends well, and I started inviting their friends to spend the night.

Some parents thought their kids were too young to start sleepovers in kindergarten, but others gladly allowed their kids to spend the night on a futon in my basement, appreciating the freedom to have a date night or spend one-on-one time with a sibling without having to hire a sitter. Watching my kids enjoy pizza and movies past their bedtime always brought a smile to my face.

More kids than I can count had their first sleepover at my house, and I loved that so many parents and kids felt so comfortable with my family.

My kids started sleeping at friends' houses, too

At first, my kids preferred hosting sleepovers at our house, where they felt most comfortable. I never pushed my kids to sleep over someone else's house. However, I let them know that whenever they were ready, their friends were eager to host them for the night. Before their kindergarten year was over, each of my kids decided to pack their bags, grab their pillows, and have their first sleepover.

There is one non-negotiable rule my kids had to follow

As a 5-year-old, my daughter and I made the walk down the block and around the corner together for her first sleepover. She told me that she was equal parts nervous and excited.

I reminded her of my one non-negotiable rule she had to follow.

No matter what, if she started to feel uncomfortable for any reason, even in the middle of the night, she had to call me and let me know she wanted to be picked up.

My kids know that I will always pick them up from sleepovers any time

To make both my kids and me feel better, whenever they head out for a sleepover, whether as kindergartners or teens, I remind them that I will pick them up, no questions asked. This reassures both of us.

When my kids were younger, I always let the host parents know that I expected my kids to be able to use the phone to call me at any hour, even if that meant waking them up in the middle of the night. No one ever took issue with this request. If they had, I would have called off the sleepover immediately.

Now that my kids are older, they have their own phones and know they can, and should, use them if they want to leave a sleepover. My kids all know that when they are at sleepovers, I leave my phone on all night in case they need me. They also know that if they want an easy out, I will take the blame, telling the host family that there is a family emergency or an important event I had forgotten about so they don't need to feel embarrassed about being picked up or feel as though they owe a host family an explanation that might make them feel uncomfortable.

I keep my word

Most sleepovers go off without a hitch. However, when my son was in sixth grade, my phone started ringing in the middle of the night. Groggily, I picked up to hear my son telling me he wanted to come home right away. I got in the car in my pajamas to pick him up, letting my son know that he didn't have to tell me what had happened, but that I was glad he called. I told him that I would tell the host family that I needed him to come home, but wouldn't elaborate.

Weeks later, my son told me that he had gotten into what, in hindsight, was a minor disagreement with one of the boys at the sleepover. I reassured him that he did the right thing by calling the moment he felt uncomfortable.

I was relieved that my years of telling my kids they could leave a sleepover anytime they wanted to come home had sunk in."
left_lean,"Senate Republicans took a major step toward delivering President Donald Trump his “big, beautiful bill” late Saturday, though the fate of the giant tax cuts and spending measure is still in question as other hurdles remain.

After an hourslong push by Senate GOP leaders Saturday, the bill cleared a key procedural vote, 51-49. Republican leaders must now satisfy numerous holdouts still demanding changes to the bill. Trump’s multitrillion-dollar bill would lower federal taxes and infuse more money into the Pentagon and border security agencies, while downsizing government safety-net programs including Medicaid.

The timeline is extremely tight: Trump has demanded to sign the bill on the Fourth of July, but the measure must still go back to the House if it passes the Senate. Saturday’s vote allows the Senate to begin debating Trump’s bill, teeing up a final passage vote in that chamber as soon as Monday.

In a late-night post on social media, Trump declared a “GREAT VICTORY” after the bill cleared the Senate, offering praise to four key senators who shifted their votes to get the procedural bill over the finish line.

“Tonight we saw a GREAT VICTORY in the Senate with the ‘GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,’ but, it wouldn’t have happened without the Fantastic Work of Senator Rick Scott, Senator Mike Lee, Senator Ron Johnson, and Senator Cynthia Lummis. They, along with all of the other Republican Patriots who voted for the Bill, are people who truly love our Country!” the president said on his Truth Social platform.

Republican Sens. Thom Tillis and Rand Paul voted against the measure.

Vice President JD Vance traveled to the Capitol on Saturday evening to help Senate Majority Leader John Thune convince remaining holdouts, including the handful of GOP hardliners who demanded more changes to the bill. As president of the Senate, Vance was also on hand in case he needed to break a tie.

Thune and Vance huddled in the leadership suite with Johnson, Lee, Scott and Lummis ahead of the final vote, before all four eventually voted to advance the measure.

Earlier Saturday, GOP leaders managed to win over one key skeptic — Sen. Lisa Murkowski. As they sought Murkowski’s vote, a few provisions in the latest version of the bill were added that specifically benefited her state of Alaska. One of those expanded how much a special group of whalers could deduct in whaling supplies, a source told CNN.

“VERY PROUD OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TONIGHT,” Trump said in his Truth Social post.

Senate Democrats are now forcing a major delay tactic to slow the chamber’s passage of Trump’s agenda, forcing clerks to spend an estimated 10 to 15 hours reading aloud the entire bill. After the reading, there would be debate on the bill, followed by a “vote-a-rama” before a vote on final passage.

Thune and his team had been fiercely lobbying their members to get in line behind the measure, with Trump and White House officials also leaning heavily on the GOP holdouts.

Trump met with Scott and Johnson on Saturday, just hours before GOP leaders hoped to hold the vote, according to those two senators’ close colleague, Lee of Utah. Trump also spoke to other critical senators, such as Josh Hawley of Missouri, who earlier Saturday declared his support for the bill. Sen. Paul of Kentucky, another critic of the bill, golfed with the president Saturday morning, according to Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

After the vote, Johnson told reporters that deficit hawks had worked out a deal with leadership on an amendment vote to cap enrollment in Medicaid expansion, which they argue will accrue significant savings. However, Johnson would not say whether he’ll back the final bill if the amendment is not adopted.

Scott would not get into the details of what was worked out with leadership but told reporters: “Every one of us wants to support the president’s agenda. … We all wanted to get to yes, and so we’re all working together to make sure that happens.”

Earlier Saturday, Trump took to Truth Social to attack Tillis and Paul for their votes against advancing the measure. He said that Tillis “is making a BIG MISTAKE” and that he will meet with those looking to mount primary challenges against the North Carolina senator “over the coming weeks.”

“What’s wrong with this guy???” Trump posted of Paul.

House Republicans, meanwhile, held a 15-minute call on Saturday, during which Speaker Mike Johnson sought to rally his troops behind the bill and tamp down on any public consternation from his own members. A frustrated Johnson urged his members to keep their powder dry and refrain from weighing in publicly on the Senate’s version of the bill, as so much of it is in flux — which means no posts on X, three sources said.

At least one Republican, Rep. David Valadao of California, posted publicly that he opposed the Senate bill because of changes to Medicaid. And another Republican who is closely watching the Medicaid provisions, Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, told CNN: “I don’t like it. We had hit a sweet spot with our bill.”

Now that the Senate has cleared the first procedural hurdle on the bill, Thune faces an entirely different headache.

After the bill’s reading and debate over the measure, senators will move to a marathon session known as a vote-a-rama. The open-ended, hourslong series of votes on amendments — some political, some substantive — will be offered mostly by Democrats and put Republicans on the spot. The votes are likely to provide fodder for campaign ads down the line.

But this vote-a-rama could be more than just politically painful for Republicans: At least one Republican holdout has signaled she will offer her own amendments to the bill in an unusual move for a GOP bill.

Key Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she wants changes to the bill made through the amendment process or she might vote against it in the end. Her negotiations throughout the session will be critical.

""The Federal Trade Commission is sending refunds totaling more than $126 million to players of the popular video game Fortnite who were charged for unwanted purchases while playing the game,"" the FTC said in a statement on Wednesday. This latest round of payments come after $72 million was issued out to players in the first round of refunds, sent in December 2024.

 

The deadline for additional claims has been extended, allowing further eligible consumers, who have not yet submitted a claim, the chance to request a refund. The FTC’s action against Epic involves ""two separate record-breaking settlements."" In December 2022, it was announced that Epic would have to pay $245 million in refunds for ""tricking users into making unwanted charges."" The FTC alleged that the gaming company “used dark patterns to trick players into making unwanted purchases and let children rack up unauthorized charges without any parental involvement.” The FTC further alleged that Fortnite's “counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration” aided in these unwanted purchases. It was also announced that Epic would be required to pay a $275 million penalty for ""violating"" the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Epic issued a statement regarding the settlement in December 2022. “The video game industry is a place of fast-moving innovation, where player expectations are high and new ideas are paramount,” the statement read. “Statutes written decades ago don’t specify how gaming ecosystems should operate. The laws have not changed, but their application has evolved and long-standing industry practices are no longer enough.”



The company went on to say: ""Over the past few years, we’ve been making changes to ensure our ecosystem meets the expectations of our players and regulators, which we hope will be a helpful guide for others in our industry."" Here’s what you need to know about whether you’re eligible to file a claim and how you can go about doing that. Who is eligible to file a claim? If you filed a claim after Feb. 14, 2025, you don’t need to do anything else right now, per the FTC's instruction, as they are ""still reviewing claims filed after that date and will provide more information soon."" For those who haven't already filed, Fortnite players who were charged for “unwanted purchases” may be eligible to seek a refund. The first eligible party is someone who was charged “in-game currency” for items they did not want, between January 2017 and September 2022. The second is a parent whose child made charges in Fortnite using their credit card, without their knowledge, between January 2017 and November 2018. The third is a player who was locked out of their account when they complained to their credit card company about “wrongful charges” between January 2017 and September 2022.



Players of all ages are eligible for the refund, but the FTC stipulates that those under 18 must have a parent or guardian fill out the claimant form on their behalf. The refund is also currently only available to players in the United States.

The FTC has reopened the claiming process for eligible people to submit a refund request. People now have until July 9 to file a claim. How can you apply for a refund? Eligible persons can apply for a refund via the official Fortnite refund website, using either a claim number sent to their email address or their Epic Games account ID. In December 2024, the FTC said the average refund amount that an individual would receive was $114, but it now says that the amount of each refund depends on multiple factors, including how many people file a claim.

Claimants can reach a representative through the email admin@fortniterefund.com or by calling number 1-833-915-0880, if they have questions about their payment status.

The refunds are due to be sent by check or via PayPal from the FTC. It’s recommended that successful claimants cash checks within 90 days and redeem the PayPal payment within 30 days."

My wife and I both went to college and graduated with bachelor's degrees. On the whole, I think we'd both agree that college was worth it for us. We got to have the careers we wanted. College degrees helped us to build a stable, prosperous, and interesting life.

But college isn't for everyone. And our oldest child is on a very different path — a flight path.

That's right: our 17-years-old son wants to be an airline pilot. And airline pilots don't have to go to college. Instead of a four-year degree, we're considering a different plan for him where he would stay at home for a year after high school and complete his pilot training at a private flight school near our home.

Here are a few reasons why I'm totally fine with my son skipping college.

College doesn't feel ""worth it"" for many Americans

Several decades of rising tuition, high levels of student loan debt, and widespread economic uncertainty in the job market, have led many Americans to no longer believe that college is always worth the cost. A Pew Research survey in 2024 found that only 22% of Americans believe that college is worth taking out loans to pay for.

My wife and I are lucky. Our student loans were manageable, and have been paid off for many years. But not every college graduate feels like their degree was a great investment and not every degree leads to a guaranteed six-figure salary. And if you run into financial trouble, student loans can be hard to get rid of. It can be difficult to get them discharged through bankruptcy, and the government can garnish your wages if you fall behind on student loan payments.

The American college experience isn't always a carefree time of football games, fraternity parties, and Frisbee on the quad. It can be a big financial risk. Not every family wants to take that risk.

We don't. We'd rather support our son in getting exactly the right training that he wants to have for his career, without spending a bunch of money on extra classes that he's not as interested in.

College isn't for everyone

Not everyone is cut out for full-time academic coursework — and that's okay. If a kid has already spent the first 18 years of their life going to school and following rules and doing homework and sitting indoors under fluorescent lights, they might not be excited for another four years of that experience.

Many young people go off to college — and rack up a few semesters' worth of student loans — only to find that they don't want to sit in a classroom anymore, so they drop out. The financial stakes of making the wrong decisions about college can be high.

People who don't finish their degree are twice as likely to default on their student loans. If you're not 100% sure that college is right for you, you might be better off not going.

My son is in this category. He's good at high school, and he takes AP math and science classes, but he's highly motivated and focused on being an airline pilot. He doesn't want to be in a classroom, he wants to be in a cockpit. I don't want to hold him back from doing what he's most interested in and passionate about.

We're focused on our child's needs

If our son wanted to go to college and be an airline pilot, we would support him in that. There are great four-year universities and two-year community colleges that offer pilot training combined with academic degree programs. But we think a private flight school (with no college attached) might be a better fit for what he needs. He can live at home, save money on rent and car payments, and get flight training at our local airport — everything he needs to launch straight into his flying career.

And most importantly, even aside from the money, fast-tracking his future with a private flight school just feels like what our son needs. He's passionate and highly motivated about aviation. He's taken aviation classes and private flight lessons while in high school. He's exceptionally level-headed and responsible. He's learning all the Federal Aviation Administration rules, airplane mechanics, and aviation lingo. He's already spent hundreds of hours training with flight simulation software. This is what he wants to be when he grows up, and he's ready to go after it, full throttle. And we're ready to watch him fly."
left_lean,"Speaking a day after the Supreme Court ended its term with a burst of high-profile decisions, Chief Justice John Roberts on Saturday warned “political people” against criticizing judges and shrugged off critics if they are “venting” just because they lost.

Without addressing the court’s blockbuster decisions, including the high-profile ruling limiting the power of courts to act as a check on President Donald Trump, Roberts stressed the importance of an independent judiciary and warned against politicians expressing hostility toward jurists.

“I’ve been compelled over the past few years to make statements about people on one side of the aisle – their views on judges – and on the other side,” Roberts told a conference of judges meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina. “It becomes wrapped up in the political dispute that a judge who’s doing his or her job is part of the problem.”

A few months ago, an audience listening to Roberts’ remarks might have read a subtle message about Trump between those lines. In March, the chief justice issued a striking statement pushing back on White House talking points that increasingly targeted judges – including with threats to impeach those who ruled against Trump.

But more recently, Roberts and his conservative colleagues on the court have given the president far more reasons to celebrate than complain. The most significant example of that landed Friday, when a 6-3 majority backed Trump in his months-long fight over nationwide court orders that have paused many of his controversial executive orders.

Democrats and left-leaning groups decried that ruling on Friday, arguing it kneecapped the ability of courts to stop a president’s policy even if it violates the law.

“The danger, of course, is somebody might pick up on that, and we have had, of course, serious threats of violence and murder of judges just simply for doing their work,” said Roberts, who was speaking to a conference organized by the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals. “I think the political people on both sides of the aisle need to keep that in mind.”

Speaking with Judge Albert Diaz, the chief judge of the 4th Circuit, Roberts recognized that the court had dealt with with six major cases on its final day – more than usual. In addition to the ruling on nationwide injunctions, the court also sided with religious parents who want to opt their children out of reading LGBTQ books in schools and upheld a Texas law that requires age verification for pornographic websites.

“Things were a little crunched toward the end this year,” Roberts said, suggesting the court might “try to space it out a little better next year, I suppose.”

Taking criticism over the court’s opinions, Roberts said, is par for the course. But the chief justice also said that “usually” such criticism has more to do with the fact that a party lost rather than any sense they didn’t get a fair hearing.

“It’s not the judge’s fault that a correct interpretation of the law meant that, no, you don’t get to do this,” Roberts said. “If it’s just venting because you lost, then that’s not terribly helpful.”"
left_lean,"A Mexican drug cartel hired a hacker to surveil the movements of a senior FBI official in Mexico City in 2018 or earlier, gathering information from the city’s camera system that allowed the cartel to kill potential FBI informants, the Justice Department inspector general said in a new report.

The hacker also was able to “see calls made and received” by the FBI official and their geolocation data in a major breach of operational security that occurred as the FBI was working on the case of former Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera, the inspector general said.

The hacker tracked people coming in and out of the US Embassy in Mexico City before zeroing in on the FBI’s assistant legal attache, a role that works closely with Mexican law enforcement, the report said, citing an FBI case agent at the time. The report did not identify the hacker.

“According to the case agent, the cartel used (information provided by the hacker) to intimidate and, in some instances, kill potential sources or cooperating witnesses,” says the inspector general report, which was a broader review of the FBI’s approach to protecting sensitive information and avoiding surveillance.

The stunning new details offer a rare look at how technology can be exploited in the high-stakes battle between US law enforcement and the violent Mexican cartels that control illicit drug trade. The Trump administration has made cracking down on cartels a national security priority, in part by declaring them as foreign terrorist groups.

The FBI, DEA and US military have in recent years used advanced surveillance techniques to try to infiltrate Sinaloa and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, the other big Mexican cartel that US officials say smuggles large volumes of deadly fentanyl into the US. CNN reported in April that the CIA was reviewing its authorities to use lethal force against the cartels.

With El Chapo now behind bars, the cartels themselves are increasingly run by a younger generation of tech-savvy drug lords. “We’ve identified people in the cartels that specialize in cryptocurrency movements,” a senior DEA official previously told CNN.

“The cartels run a multi-billion-dollar global enterprise and utilize sophisticated technology to enhance their business operations,” Derek Maltz, who until May served as the acting DEA administrator, told CNN. “They utilize state-of-art sophisticated surveillance techniques to identify law enforcement activities and their adversaries.”

The new inspector general report raises broader concerns about the threat of high-tech surveillance to US national security.

“Some within the FBI and partner agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), have described this threat as ‘existential,” the report said.

There have been “longstanding” risks posed by “ubiquitous technical surveillance” — jargon for the widespread availability of data to adversaries — to the FBI’s criminal and national security cases, the report said. But recent advances in commercial technology “have made it easier than ever for less-sophisticated nations and criminal enterprises to identify and exploit vulnerabilities” related to such surveillance, according to the report.

The FBI is working on a “strategic plan” to address some of the inspector general’s concerns about the bureau’s approach to the threat, the report said.

The bureau referred questions about the inspector general’s report to the Justice Department. CNN has requested comment from the department."

As I stood in an airless bus shuttling me from my budget airline to the terminal at Venice's airport, the day before Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's wedding, I looked out the window and saw Kim Kardashian's private jet.

A bead of sweat dripped down my forehead, and I imagined her handlers whisking her to a private exit, where a speedboat would be waiting to take her into the city.

I wanted to ask locals what they thought of a wedding that was either a display of extreme or aspirational wealth — depending on who you asked — in a city where overtourism, high living costs, and homes becoming holiday rentals had seen the population drop by 120,000 to about 50,000 since the 1950s.

I found two competing visions of the city. One was pristine and curated: a backdrop for black-tie photo ops whose guests arrived by private jet. The other was chaotic, crumbling, overwhelming, and imperfect, but lived in.

From the moment I arrived in Venice, the difference between what the ultra-rich, the average tourist, and the locals experienced was impossible to miss.

I used the 50-minute wait in the sun for a crowded vaporetto — Venice's public water bus — into the city to people-watch.

I looked from a distance behind a chain-linked fence as a steady stream of VIPs — most notably Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King — stepped from a private dock onto private water taxis. Paparazzi lenses clicked beside me.

The boats, some carrying only luggage, were headed to five-star hotels accessible only by water, the canals acting like moats.

Feeling flustered, both by what I'd just seen and by the 84-degree Fahrenheit heat, I asked the receptionist at my three-star, slightly dated but perfectly adequate hotel what she thought of the wedding.

She wasn't bothered. Venice has bigger problems, she told me: pickpocketing, boats damaging historic foundations, and overtourism.

Many Venetians I spoke to echoed that sentiment. The wedding felt distant—a media circus that barely touched their lives.

""It doesn't affect us,"" Francesca Babolini, a Venetian photographer, told me while working on her laptop in a café near one of the main squares.

""He's not the first or the last rich man to come to Venice,"" he told me, adding that the city is ""absolutely"" used to hosting the wealthy in its palazzos, churches, and canals. Once a major trading center between Europe and Asia, it has, of course, long been a destination for the rich and powerful.

At the Rialto market — the city's main market, which has been open for seven centuries — traders greeted regulars and haggled over the price of spices, fresh fish, vegetables, and fruit, including gigantic beefsteak tomatoes.

The museums were open as usual, and tourists lined up outside, squinting at their maps in the sun. The vaporetto ran on time, although boarding was a battle, with people elbowing for space on already packed decks.

At Piazza San Marco, however, there was a break from the routine.

Many protests had taken place in advance of the Bezos-Sanchez wedding, largely coordinated by a pop-up group called ""No Space for Bezos,"" and one was underway at Piazza San Marco. A person had climbed one of the three flagpoles in Venice's central square.

In a similar spot on Monday, Greenpeace rolled out a huge banner with Bezos' face, reading: ""If you can rent Venice for your wedding, you can pay more tax."" The following day, protesters climbed a crane to put up a sign that said: ""Tax the rich to give back to the planet.""

Activists had planned to block the city's canals and fill them with inflatable alligators to delay wedding guests headed for the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, a venue in the heart of the city. But the couple moved the final-day wedding celebration to near the Arsenale, an area further out from the center.

When the protester finally descended the pole, police carried him away. The crowd erupted in support of the activist, while others shouted: ""Shame!""

It was a brief reminder that not everyone was indifferent to Bezos and Sanchez's choice of Venice as their destination wedding.

Tommaso Cacciari's family has lived in Venice for four generations. Pierfrancesco Celada for BI

Tommaso Cacciari, an activist and fourth-generation Venetian, was among those who helped organize protests against what they saw as a boastful spectacle in their hometown.

""Jeff Bezos, in his amazing arrogance, thought that he would come, not to a city, but to a theme park,"" he said. ""He wanted to use Venice as a background, we used him to speak about the real problems of Venice.""

For Cacciari, the wedding isn't just another celebrity event; it's a symbol of how, in his view, the city caters to the superrich rather than the people who work, grind, and, increasingly, struggle to live here.

""Bezos found out that Venice is not yet only a theme park,"" he went on. ""It's still lived in by citizens, by activists, by people who love their city and want to change the way it's being run.""

The respective representatives of Bezos and Sanchez and the mayor of Venice didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from BI.

A protest march was planned for Saturday night, but so far, the activists and the wedding party had yet to meaningfully collide. Judging by how closed off the celebrations were, it seemed unlikely the protesters would get close.

The luxury hotels were impenetrable. I tried to get into five of them and was turned away every time.

From the early hours each morning, paparazzi camped a canal-length away from the Aman hotel, which was Bezos and Sanchez's wedding basecamp, to get their shots, which were often obscured by a gazebo placed outside the entrance to shield guests from public view.

Swarms of police officers blocked access to the Chiesa della Madonna dell'Orto church, where Bezos and Sanchez were hosting a welcome party.

By Friday, the closest the press and curious tourists could get to the celebrities, who would be attending a party at San Giorgio Maggiore, was a workers' entrance. From there, we saw little more than a fence and a row of security guards.

But few locals were even looking.

As Bezos and Sánchez's wedding played out behind barricades and blackout gazebos, the rest of Venice carried on.

They opened their shops and shouted into phones between puffs of cigarettes. Meanwhile, tourists leaned against stone walls, licking melting gelato.

On the same island where the Bezos-Sánchez wedding was taking place, another couple did a wedding photo shoot. There were no bodyguards, fences, or entourage — just a bride avoiding spending too long in the sun to keep her makeup from melting.

Aside from the occasional short-lived protest, anti-Bezos posters scattered around the city, and the occasional security cordon, you might not have known anything was happening at all.

Two Venices existed in parallel that weekend — one arriving by private jet, slipping onto speedboats; the other waiting in line for the vaporetto, fanning itself in the heat.

Cacciari, the protester, said he loves this version of the city, with all its chaos and friction.

""A city is a place where people meet, where people even fight,"" he said. ""It's the melting of cultures — even the conflict between cultures."""

I am the daughter of an immigrant mother from the Philippines. I became a lawyer because my mother wanted me to be one, not because I wanted to be one.

While legal work pays well, I felt unfulfilled. So when I had kids, I encouraged them to do what they truly love.

My mom's dream career for me was a lawyer

My mother came to the United States at age 16 and worked hard to give me as many advantages as possible here. She paid for me to attend great schools. She wanted me to become a doctor, but I fainted at the sight of blood. So, she switched her dream to my having a career as a lawyer.

As a first-generation American, I felt beholden to my immigrant parents. The immigrant road is not an easy one. They came to the US to achieve what they considered to be the American dream, equating success with monetary gain.

But wealth does not guarantee happiness.

I realized this when I turned 50

This reality hit me in my 50th year. I had worked in one of Washington, D.C.'s largest law firms, enjoyed a political appointment in the US Justice Department, was married to a well-to-do attorney, took lavish vacations, and belonged to a country club. But I felt empty.

My marriage eventually fell apart, and I developed a drinking problem to anesthetize my feelings. At least the law paid well, and I could support myself.

I regret not following my dreams from the start. I would have liked to have become a broadcast journalist or television commentator. Those were not career paths smiled upon by my hardworking immigrant mom, but they would have made me happier about my work.

At age 50, I changed my life. I started my own podcast and was a co-host of a Washington, D.C. radio show. I did a TEDx Talk and secured speaking gigs. These endeavors gave me a taste of what could have been had I had the courage to pursue my own passions.

At age 50, the author decided to try 50 new things. Courtesy of the author

In my 50th year, I tried 50 new things to determine how I wanted to live my next chapter. It looks nothing like what my mother would have chosen, but she understands that this time, my choices are for me, not for her.

I encourage my kids to follow their dreams

I encouraged my children to do what made them happy. My daughter is studying to become a social worker, which is not a high-paying profession. She enjoys helping people in need, and the career suits her. Money is not her motivation.

My son pursued an education in the arts. Artistic careers are risky from a monetary perspective, but he excelled as a social media influencer, singer, and actor, and has already made more in one year than I ever did as an attorney.

I think the younger generations have realized that wealth does not create happiness. They are defining success for themselves. Those of us in the baby boomer generation generally had more of a sense of obligation. We were taught to respect our parents by doing what they wanted, and that was even more true for first-generation boomers like me.

I can see now that my mother's imposition of her desires did me a disservice. She never asked me what I wanted for my life. Perhaps I would not have had a good answer in my 20s.

The author encourages her kids to follow their dreams. Courtesy of the author

But I have a good answer now. I strive for work and endeavors that bring me closer to my authentic self. I surround myself with people who support me and encourage my individuality.

At age 61, I am lucky to still be healthy. I acknowledge that no one is responsible for my happiness but me. I honor my own choices and feelings. I am now living a life true to my own values. My life does not look like what I expected, nor what my mom expected. But it is finally all mine.

left_lean,"A large sum of riches descended upon Venice, Italy, over the last few days for the lavish wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez.

Opulence has been on full display as some of the famous attendees arrived at the canal city by private planes, helicopters and yachts before they were whisked away on water taxis to ferry them to the festivities. Pinpointing the combined wealth of this closely guarded guest list would be a painstaking and exhausting exercise but an estimate of their total net worth would likely be in the neighborhood of $435 billion.

Much of the total wealth can be attributed to the groom. Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the third richest man in the world, is estimated to be worth about $244 billion, according to ’s billionaire index.

But the wedding guests also boast sizable fortunes. Trailing not too far behind Bezos is Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who is listed at No. 5 on ’s list at $178 billion.

Absent from Bezos’ wedding were the top two richest people in the world: Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($367 billion) and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg ($258 billion). In fact, Gates is the only confirmed wedding guest who cracks ’s list of the 500 richest people.

Coming in well behind Bezos and Gates are two media moguls who have dropped off ’s billionaire index: Barry Diller and Oprah Winfrey.

 estimates that Diller is worth almost $6 billion, which is under the $6.88 billion net worth of the No. 500 person on ’s list. In 2018, Winfrey was listed at No. 494 on the  Billionaire Index at $4 billion. Winfrey is currently estimated to be worth north of $3 billion.

Deep-pocketed guests

Of the 200 or so confirmed guests, none boast the portfolios of Bezos, Gates, Diller and Winfrey, but there is still plenty of wealth to go around. The closely guarded guest list includes tech leaders, pop stars, media personalities, actors and athletes.

Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, is in Venice for the Bezos-Sanchez wedding. Altman was reportedly worth at least $2 billion in March 2024, according to . That figure did not include Altman’s stake in OpenAI, which  reported in April finalized a $40 billion funding round, valuing the company at $300 billion.

Also in attendance is Kim Kardashian, who is estimated to be worth $1.7 billion, according to Forbes. She was in Venice alongside sisters Khloe Kardashian, Kendall and Kylie Jenner and their mother Kris Jenner. While the family’s reality TV show pushed Kim Kardashian further into the public eye, her shapewear company Skims, which is believed to be valued at $4 billion as of July 2023, is believed to be a major source of her wealth.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Warren Buffett has announced his latest charitable donation — a whopping $6 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway shares.

The 94-year-old Berkshire chairman announced Friday that he would donate about 12.4 million Class B shares to five foundations.

Most of the shares — about 9.4 million ($4.6 billion worth) — are headed for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, which was founded by the Microsoft cofounder and his ex-wife.

The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after Buffett's first wife, is set to receive about 943,000 of the shares, while roughly 660,000 are destined for each of the Sherwood Foundation, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, and the NoVo Foundation, according to a statement.

Buffett, whose net worth as of Friday was $152 billion, according to the  Billionaires Index, pledged in 2006 to give away the vast majority of his fortune to philanthropic causes, and he has since made large annual donations to these foundations.

In Friday's statement, he outlined some of the math behind his 2006 pledge: ""When originally made, I owned 474,998 Berkshire A shares worth about $43 billion and those shares represented more than 98% of my net worth. I have converted A shares into B shares before making contributions.""

""During the following 19 years, I have neither bought nor sold any A or B shares nor do I intend to do so,"" he continued. ""The five foundations have received Berkshire B shares that had a value when received of about $60 billion, substantially more than my entire net worth in 2006. I have no debts and my remaining A shares are worth about $145 billion, well over 99% of my net worth.""

Reflecting on his success, Buffett added that ""nothing extraordinary"" had happened at Berkshire, instead pointing to ""a very long runway, simple and generally sound decisions, the American tailwind and compounding effects.""

His stake in Berkshire now comprises 198,117 Class A shares and 1,144 Class B shares."
left_lean,"A notorious cybercriminal group has shifted its attention to the aviation industry, successfully breaching the computer networks of multiple airlines in the United States and Canada this month, according to the FBI and private experts responding to the hacks.

The hacking hasn’t affected airline safety, but it has top cyber executives at major airlines across the United States on alert because of the hacking suspects: A network of young cybercriminals called “Scattered Spider” who are known for their aggressive efforts to extort or embarrass their victims.

It’s a fresh headache for the travel industry as the busy summer travel season kicks into high gear. This is now the third major US business sector in the last two months, after insurance and retail, to face a flurry of cyberattacks tied to the criminal group.

The hackers target big companies and their IT contractors, “which means anyone in the airline ecosystem, including trusted vendors and contractors, could be at risk,” the FBI said Friday night in a statement that named Scattered Spider as the perpetrator of the airline hacks. “Once inside (a victim’s network), Scattered Spider actors steal sensitive data for extortion and often deploy ransomware,” the FBI said.

The FBI, the statement continued, “is actively working with aviation and industry partners to address this activity and assist victims.”

Hawaiian Airlines and Canada’s WestJet confirmed this week that they were still assessing the fallout from recent cyberattacks, though the airlines did not name the perpetrators. More victims in the aviation industry could come forward, sources briefed on the investigation said.

WestJet’s issues began two weeks ago, when the airline said it was responding to a “cybersecurity incident” that was affecting access “to some services and software systems,” including its app for customers. Both WestJet and Hawaiian Airlines said their operations were unaffected by the hacks.

The lack of impact on operations at the airlines is “likely a sign of good internal network separations or good business continuity and resiliency planning,” said Aakin Patel, the former chief information security officer of Las Vegas’ main airport.

It is not just the airlines themselves, but other “segments of the aviation ecosystem” that are seeing increased cyberattacks, according to Jeffey Troy, the president of the Aviation ISAC, an industry group for sharing cyber threats. “Our members are keenly alert to attacks from financially motivated attackers and collateral impacts emanating out of geo-political tensions around the world,” Troy said in a statement to CNN.

The fine margins for error in the airline industry were on display Friday, when a separate IT outage, apparently unrelated to malicious cyber activity, caused delays for some American Airlines passengers.

The Scattered Spider hacks have mobilized people across the industry to respond. In-house cybersecurity experts at major airlines have been closely monitoring the situation, sources familiar with the response told CNN, while cybersecurity firms such as Google-owned Mandiant are helping with the recovery and urging airlines to secure their customer service call centers.

One of Scattered Spiders’ preferred methods of infiltrating corporations is calling up help desks and pretending to be employees or customers. The technique has been highly effective for hackers to gain access to the networks of big companies.

“Airlines rely heavily on call centers for a lot of their support needs,” Patel told CNN, making them “a likely target for groups like this.”

Scattered Spider gained attention in September 2023 when they were linked to a pair of multimillion-dollar hacks on Las Vegas casinos and hotels MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. The hackers tend to pick one sector to target for weeks on end. Earlier this month, they were the suspect in a hack of insurance giant Aflac that potentially stole Social Security numbers, insurance claims and health information. Before that, it was the retail sector: The hackers, according to an internal memo obtained by CNN, targeted Ahold Delhaize USA, which has the same parent company as the Giant and Food Lion grocery chains.

“The actor’s core tactics, techniques, and procedures have remained consistent,” Mandiant chief technology officer Charles Carmakal said Friday in a statement, and that it “is aware of multiple incidents in the airline and transportation sector” that resemble the operations of Scattered Spider."

The IDF says they spotted Israeli civilians driving toward a closed military zone near the Palestinian village of Kafr Malik, where days earlier settlers set fire to homes and vehicles in an attack Palestinian officials say killed three people.

When Israeli forces approached the group, the IDF says the soldiers were physically assaulted and verbally abused. In addition, the suspects vandalized and damaged the security forces’ vehicles and attempted to ram the forces.

The IDF said that a preliminary investigation indicated that their forces had fired three warning shots into the air, but did not fire live ammunition at civilians.

Six suspects were apprehended and transferred to police, the IDF said.

“The IDF and Israel Police condemn any act of violence against security forces and will act firmly against any attempt to harm security personnel carrying out their duty to protect Israeli citizens,” the IDF said in a statement.

Most Israeli politicians condemned the settler attacks against Israeli security forces.

In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for a thorough investigation and for the people who attacked the security forces to be brought to justice.

“These individuals are a small minority who do not represent the vast majority of settlers, who respect the law and serve in the IDF and the security forces,” Netanyahu said.

Head of the opposition Yair Lapid said in a statement on social media, “The extremists who attack IDF soldiers who are guarding the security of the State of Israel during these difficult days are dangerous criminals who are aiding our enemies.”

Yair Golan, the head of the left-wing Democrats party, who had called earlier settler attacks in the area a “violent Jewish pogrom,” said the violence from “the Kahanist, nationalist, and fantastic Israel is deliberately working to dismantle the Jewish and democratic Israel.” Golan referenced Meir Kahane, an extremist rabbi whose political party was banned outright in Israel under anti-terror laws.

“This is not a marginal occurrence. This is a dangerous current that has taken deep roots. Even around the government table,” Golan said, a reference to the far-right ministers that prop up the coalition government, including Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, both of whom were sanctioned earlier this month by the UK, Canada, and other Western allies.

Smotrich has called for formal annexation of West Bank settlements, while Ben-Gvir’s party consists of followers of Kahane’s banned political party.

Responding to the latest incident, Smotrich, who serves as Israel’s Finance Minister and as a minister in the Ministry of Defense, said there should be a “thorough investigation” into whether the IDF had fired on the settlers, an action he described as a “forbidden and dangerous red line.”

“The IDF and the settlers are one and the same. Anyone who raises a hand against IDF soldiers is fighting against the settlement movement, not for it,” Smotrich said. “And still – live fire on Jews is unacceptable and dangerous.”

In a statement, Defense Minister Israel Katz called on law enforcement authorities to act immediately to locate all those who resorted to violence and bring them to justice “as is done everywhere.”

On Friday, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman for the Palestinian Authority presidency, said the settler attacks are part of a plan by Israel’s “extremist right-wing government” to drag the West Bank into a larger confrontation, according to the Palestinian news agency WAFA. Abu Rudeineh held Israel fully responsible for “the consequences of this bloody aggression,” WAFA said.

Israel has been ramping up military operations in the West Bank alongside the offensive in Gaza and attacks on Iran and its proxies, displacing thousands of Palestinians and razing entire communities as it targets what it says are militants operating in the territory.

Earlier this week, Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian teenager in the West Bank, Palestinian health authorities said. The Israeli military said that “terrorists hurled explosive devices at IDF forces.”

In late-May, Israel approved a massive expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank in a move decried as de facto annexation of large swaths of the territory. Peace Now, an Israeli non-governmental organization that tracks settlements, said it was the largest expansion of settlements since the signing of the Oslo Accords more than 30 years ago.

Israel plans to establish 22 new settlements, including deep within the West Bank and in areas from which the country had previously withdrawn. Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, as well as in East Jerusalem and the occupied Golan Heights, are considered illegal under international law."
left_lean,"President Donald Trump issued blistering remarks in response to Iran’s Supreme Leader claiming victory over Israel and, by extension, the U.S. In a loaded public message, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had also threatened to attack more U.S. Military bases, further splintering the Middle Eastern country’s relationship with the U.S. “Look, you’re a man of great faith. A man who’s highly respected in his country. You have to tell the truth. You got beat to hell,” Trump said as he addressed the Iranian Supreme Leader during a White House press conference on Friday. Trump was asked by a reporter if the U.S. would consider bombing Iran again, if intelligence reports were to conclude that Iran could enrich uranium to a level that concerns him. ""Sure, without question, absolutely,"" he replied.

 

Trump issued an even stronger response on his social media platform, Truth Social, later in the day, and doubled down on his stance once more when he reposted his message early Saturday morning. In the lengthy post, Trump accused Khamenei of publicly sharing a “lie” by claiming Iran achieved a victory over Israel. He reaffirmed his much debated viewpoint that the U.S. strikes “obliterated” the three key nuclear facilities it targeted on Saturday, June 21. Trump also seemingly made reference to previous reports that stated the White House turned down a plan by Israel to try and kill Khamenei. “His country was decimated, his three evil nuclear sites were obliterated, and I knew exactly where he was sheltered, and would not let Israel, or the U.S. Armed Forces... terminate his life. I saved him from a very ugly and ignominious death,” Trump said, lamenting that Khamenei would not “thank” him for this. “During the last few days, I was working on the possible removal of sanctions, and other things, which would have given a much better chance to Iran at a full, fast, and complete recovery. The sanctions are biting! But no, instead I get hit with a statement of anger, hatred, and disgust, and immediately dropped all work on sanction relief.”



According to Congress, the U.S. sanctions on Iran “are arguably the most extensive and comprehensive set of sanctions that the United States maintains on any country.” They block Iranian government assets in the U.S., ban nearly all U.S. trade with Iran, and prohibit foreign assistance and arms sales. Read More: How U.S. Strikes May Have Inadvertently Helped the Iranian Regime Trump concluded his charged social media message by saying “Iran has to get back into the world order flow” or else things “will only get worse for them.” “They are always so angry, hostile, and unhappy, and look at what it has gotten them. A burned out, blown up country with no future, a decimated military, a horrible economy, and death all around them. They have no hope, and it will only get worse! I wish the leadership of Iran would realize that you often get more with honey than you do with vinegar. Peace!"" Khamenei broke his silence on Thursday, publicly speaking out—via a pre-recorded televised address and various social media comments— for the first time since Trump announced the (admittedly fragile) cease-fire between Israel and Iran.



Read More: Shaky Israel-Iran Cease-Fire Appears to Hold After Trump Publicly Rebukes Both Countries In his televised message, Khamenei threatened to attack more U.S. military bases should any further aggression from the U.S. side occur. “The Islamic Republic slapped America in the face. It attacked one of the important American bases in the region,” Khamenei said, referring to his country’s air assault on Al Udeid Air Base, a U.S. airbase in Qatar. The strikes were intercepted by the U.S. (except for one that was allowed to proceed as there was no risk of contact), and no casualties were reported. The military action was retaliatory, a direct response to the U.S. strikes on nuclear facilities. Khamenei claimed “total victory” over Israel. But Israel, the U.S., and Iran have all claimed to have won the war that started on June 13, when Israel launched strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, amid growing concern over Iran’s nuclear capabilities. When the U.S. actively joined the conflict on June 21, striking three key Iranian nuclear facilities, world leaders urged de-escalation and a return to negotiations, amid fears of a far-reaching war erupting.



Read More: ‘Gravely Alarmed’ World Leaders React After U.S. Strikes Iran Though Trump continues to say that Iran’s nuclear sites were “totally obliterated,” others have cast doubts on how effective the U.S. strikes were in setting back Iran’s nuclear program. Leaked U.S. intelligence suggested that the damage to Iran’s nuclear program may not be as severe as Trump has stated. CIA director John Ratcliffe said on Wednesday that the sites had been “severely damaged” by the U.S. strikes, and that it would take years to be rebuilt. Amid the debate, the White House has put out statements arguing Trump’s stance that the facilities were ""obliterated,"" labelling reports to the contrary as ""fake news."" But some Democrats left a classified meeting with lingering questions over the effectiveness of the strikes. “There’s no doubt there was damage done to the program, but the allegations that we have obliterated their program just don’t seem to stand up to reason,” said Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut on Thursday. “To me, it still appears that we have only set back the Iranian nuclear program by a handful of months.”



When asked about concerns of Iran having “secret nuclear sites” at Friday’s press conference, Trump said he was “not worried about it at all.” “They’re exhausted. The last thing they're thinking about right now is nuclear,” he told reporters. “You know what they're thinking of? They're thinking about tomorrow, trying to live in such a mess. The place was bombed to hell.” Read More: Key Takeaways From the 2025 NATO Summit Meanwhile, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Friday that Trump needs to retire his ""disrespectful"" tone towards Khamenei if he wants a deal to be struck between the U.S. and Iran.



“If President Trump is genuine about wanting a deal, he should put aside the disrespectful and unacceptable tone towards Iran’s Supreme Leader, Grand Ayatollah Khamenei, and stop hurting his millions of heartfelt followers,” he said. ""The great and powerful Iranian people, who showed the world that the Israeli regime had no choice but to run to 'Daddy' to avoid being flattened by our missiles, do not take kindly to threats and insults.""



Araghchi was referencing remarks made by NATO chief Mark Rutte who, during the NATO Summit on Wednesday, referred to Trump as the ""daddy"" who had to intervene in the conflict between Israel and Iran.

Amid the back-and-forth between Trump and Iran, on Saturday, thousands of mourners gathered in Tehran for the funerals of top Iranian military commanders and scientists that were killed in the Israeli strikes. According to reports, crowds chanted ""death to"" Israel and America.

Araghchi paid tribute to those who had been killed, and went on to tell Iranians on Saturday that the ""pride of a nation is paramount,” pledging that Iran would return to “new glory and greater strength.""



As the funerals took place, Khamenei spoke out via a post on his Farsi-language social media account, sharing a message that translated to: ""The Iranian nation should know that the reason for the opposition to America is that they want Iran to surrender, and this is a great insult to the Iranian nation by the Americans, and such a thing will never happen."""
left_lean,"Beneath a blaze of rainbow flags and amid roars of defiance, big crowds gathered in the Hungarian capital Budapest for the city’s 30th annual Pride march – an event that, this year, is unfolding as both a celebration and a protest.

Moving through the capital in the sweltering heat, demonstrators carried signs reading “Solidarity with Budapest Pride” and waved placards bearing crossed-out illustrations of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Music played from portable speakers as people of all ages joined the march – families with pushchairs, teenagers draped in capes, and older residents walking alongside activists.

From the city’s historic centre to its riverside roads, the procession swelled in numbers and noise – visibly reclaiming public space in defiance of a law designed to push them out.

The march proceeded in open defiance of a police ban imposed earlier this year under sweeping new legislation that prohibits LGBTQ+ events nationwide.

Eszter Rein Bodi was one of those who joined the massive crowds in Budapest on Saturday, telling Reuters: “This is about much more, not just about homosexuality … This is the last moment to stand up for our rights.”

Krisztina Aranyi, another marcher, told the news agency that “the right to assembly is a basic human right, and I don’t think it should be banned.”

She added, “Just because someone does not like the reason why you go to the street, or they do not agree with it, you still have the right to do so.”

Huge crowds turned out in the city for the parade, with many holding homemade banners aloft. One sign read “Transgender people are a blessing on this earth” while another banner read “Proud. United. Equal in every corner of the EU.”

At least 70 members of the European Parliament were expected to join the procession, officials told CNN in May.

Van Sparrentak, who is a Dutch MEP from the parliament’s “Greens/European Free Alliance” political group, told CNN that she will be attending Budapest Pride to “support the LGBTIQ+ community in Hungary, to let them know that they are not alone (and) to be visible as a community.”

“Pride is a protest, and if Orbán can ban Budapest Pride without consequences, every pride is one election away from being banned,” she continued.

In March, Hungarian lawmakers passed legislation barring Pride events and permitting the use of facial recognition technology to identify participants – measures campaigners say is illegal and part of a wider crackdown on the LGBTQ+ community.

Orban welcomed the ban, which he said would outlaw gatherings that “violate child protection laws.” His government has pushed a strongly Christian and conservative agenda.

The ban sparked lively protests in Budapest in March, with organizers of the city’s Pride vowing to continue with the annual festival despite the new law and declaring: “We will fight this new fascist ban.”

A petition demanding police reject the ban has gathered over 120,000 signatures from supporters in 73 countries, urging authorities to “reject this unjust law” – believed to be the first of its kind in the EU’s recent history – and ensure that the march proceeded “unhindered and peacefully, free from discrimination, harassment, fear or violence.”

From takeout to doctor visits, soaring costs mean single Americans need every advantage they can get.

That's especially true when it comes to buying a home. As of June, the US median listing price was $440,000, according to Realtor.com, a steep cost for many Americans who live from paycheck to paycheck or are severely cost-burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing.

Finding an affordable home as a single buyer can be tough, but data can help you understand where the opportunities might be.

To determine where single people can buy homes and still live comfortably, Realtor.com combined national income threshold data — the minimum income needed to cover basic expenses like housing, food, and savings without financial hardship — from an analysis of MIT living wage calculator data by financial technology company SmartAsset, with its housing data.

The research team found that the 10 most affordable states for singles have median listing prices below $440,000, with monthly mortgage payments, excluding the cost of tax and home insurance, under $2,000 — based on a 6.81% interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage.

These states are largely in the South, reinforcing the region's existing reputation as an affordable place to live. While familiar budget-friendly spots like Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana made the list, one Southern state was surprisingly absent: Texas.

Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, told Business Insider that the state's influx of movers, drawn by relatively low home prices and better job opportunities, has been a Catch-22 for its real estate market and economy.

""The booming Texas economy has driven wages higher, but the cost of living has risen as well, making it more challenging to live comfortably on one income,"" she said.

Below are the 10 US states where it's most affordable for singles to buy a home.

For each city, Business Insider used median home price and mortgage data from Realtor.com. Income data is from SmartAsset."

While the alleged crimes are not the same, some of the cultural issues involved could describe the trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs in 2025, or that of O.J. Simpson in 1995.

Simpson’s case sparked an era of “trialtainment,” with an abundance of viewers and readers following an exhaustive round-the-clock news cycle, absorbing every detail of the bombshell murder case. Thirty years later, as the world awaits a verdict in Combs’ federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial, interest in celebrity court cases remains high, but public discourse around race and intimate partner violence has changed.

“I think a lot of women have evolved in terms of taking a stance that we can speak up. We are now just being comfortable with speaking up and this is as a result of the #MeToo movement,” legal analyst and entertainment law expert Lisa Bonner – who is not connected to either case – told CNN.

Simpson, who died in April 2024 at the age of 76 following a battle with cancer, was accused of fatally stabbing his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. The star football player and actor was acquitted in 1995.

Combs is facing allegations of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. The mogul and music artist has pleaded not guilty.

Both men had well respected careers, amassed wealth and power and initially enjoyed the support of fans, especially in the Black community.

“One thing that is different in this case than it is for Diddy is all the Black people were on O.J.’s side,” Bonner said. “It was on the heels of (the 1991 beating by Los Angeles Police Department officers of) Rodney King and all of the civil unrest that had gone on regarding the mistreatment of Black people, especially Black men.”

Both Simpson and Combs were also accused of domestic violence and in the case of Combs, some of his support slipped after CNN last year published a hotel surveillance video of him physically assaulting his then-girlfriend, singer Cassie Ventura, in 2016.

Nicole Branca, chief executive officer of New Destiny Housing, a New York City nonprofit that provides housing and services to survivors of domestic violence and their children, said high-profile trials like these can be “helpful to hold people accountable.”

“It’s probably better that there’s this much coverage because these are celebrities, these are people with a lot of money and a lot of attention and if (domestic violence is) happening to them, then maybe it makes it okay for people to speak out about their own experience,” she said. “That’s my hope. Do I know if that’s happening? I don’t, but the fact that people are more vocal about it these days and there are more laws being passed at the city, state, and federal level, makes me think that this contributes to that discourse.”

Branca pointed to the New York City Council recently introducing a bill to train first responders in the detection of traumatic brain injuries – given that such injuries are common with domestic violence victims – as an indiction that authorities are taking the issue more seriously.

Bonner, who has appeared on CNN to discuss the Combs case, said that while “there’s still a lot of victim shaming that goes on,” the cultural strides made in the past three decades likely made it easier for Ventura to file a civil suit against Combs in November 2023, which preceded a federal criminal investigation. Combs denied wrongdoing, and the two settled the lawsuit a day later.

“It’s no longer acceptable that men are allowed to act in such a manner and get away with it. Women are no longer scared to come forward,” Bonner said. “That’s the reason why Cassie was able to bring this lawsuit because of the simple fact that the #MeToo movement gave women a voice.”

Public awareness of the #MeToo movement gave rise as a hashtag in 2017, after Hollywood super producer Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual harassment and assault, but it was founded more than a decade prior by activist Tarana Burke.

What followed after Weinstein were allegations against other men in powerful positions.

Bonner said that when it comes to legal issues of the rich and the famous, “we want a light, a look into the life of a celebrity.”

“In some instances it’s a great equalizer because this person, now all of their business that is normally shrouded in secrecy, has come to the front,” she said.

An estimated 150 million people reportedly watched Simpson’s verdict in 1995. While the Combs trial has not been televised, the social media era has meant details of his alleged abuse of power and hours of trial testimony have been closely followed and discussed for months.

“It gives us a chance to weigh in on something that’s completely not our business to talk about it,” Bonner said. “It’s in the zeitgeist.”"

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

I pushed my overflowing grocery cart to my car, my receipt fluttering like a flag of surrender in my hand. The total: $345.

It was the most I had ever spent in a single shopping trip. As I drove home, I could only hope my kids would be there to help me unload all this food. I certainly knew they would eat it all.

With three hungry kids, groceries add up fast, especially in the summer. I'd been navigating that for years. But with two home from college and one in high school, grocery spending is now at an all-time high.

Summer break means a higher grocery budget, especially with college kids

Now that my college-aged son is home for the summer, my grocery bill is climbing faster than the temperature. As a health-conscious athlete, he's not just raiding the pantry for inexpensive chips; he's grabbing protein-rich foods, fresh produce, and doctor-approved supplements like creatine and protein powder — all things that carry a hefty pricetag.

Plus, he's not my only kid. My other college student doesn't live at home full-time, but is here often enough that there's a well-worn path to the fridge. My youngest, a high-school athlete, is the cherry on top of this very expensive sundae.

If you add in a constant flow of ice cream treats, kids' friends, summer BBQs, and endless snacking from everyone being home, then suddenly my grocery bill has officially entered the ""feeding a small army"" category.

I have found a few helpful cost-reducing tactics

We snagged a free fridge on a local site that we keep in the basement for overflow food. Instead of restocking the main fridge every few days while someone still claims ""there's nothing to eat,"" I have space for extra drinks, ice cream, and recipe ingredients I want to keep safe from hungry hands.

I also don't shop at warehouse stores. The membership fees and long treks aren't worth it for me. But I watch for sales and stock up when I can. Two days ago, I bought six pints of raspberries, and they are almost gone. Luckily, they're still on sale, so I'll snag some more before that ends. Why? Because my kids are eating raspberries faster than pantry snacks. That's a win. It's not just fruit, though. If you could see the number of cheese sticks and yogurts in my fridge, you'd probably think you were at a grocery store.

Prioritizing less expensive stores goes a long way. I do the majority of my shopping at Aldi as it tends to be the least expensive grocery store near me. For fresh deli meats or items Aldi doesn't carry, I swing by the closer (but pricier) store, especially when produce is on sale or Aldi's stock isn't looking fresh.

These things aren't magic, but small choices like these keep my kids satisfied while I spend a little less money.

Changing my mindset has helped, too

The most important thing I'm doing is remembering that this is a season. My kids won't be home from college for long, and friends won't be popping over for dinner when we're back to our regularly scheduled programming. Summer won't last forever.

I'd rather say yes to family ice cream nights now and tighten things up a bit when we're settled back into our school-year routines. When my kids go back to school, the grocery receipt will be far shorter, and I'll miss this.

Whether you have toddlers or 20-year-olds, summer often means more mouths, more meals, and more money. The No. 1 thing that can get you through? Just embracing the season."
left_lean,"Chief Justice John Roberts chastised President Donald Trump early on in his second term, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett pointedly questioned whether his administration would adhere to court orders.

But their public wariness of Trump was fleeting.

And on Friday, Roberts enlisted Barrett to write the opinion that dissolved one check on the president’s executive power, whether to end birthright citizenship or to enforce policies overhauling the federal government and encroaching on individual rights.

The decision, which played out dramatically in the white marble courtroom with dueling statements from Barrett and dissenting Justice Sonia Sotomayor, buttressed a pattern:

The six-justice conservative majority has aligned with Trump’s agenda in his second term. That largely arises from the justices’ own desire for expansive executive authority, be it over migrant deportations or the firing of the heads of independent agencies.

Moreover, as the high court took up LGBTQ and other social policy dilemmas in the regular session that ended Friday, the majority adopted Trump administration’s positions.

By the same 6-3 vote Friday, the justices sided with religious parents in Maryland who sought to keep their elementary school children from reading certain LGBTQ books in public schools. The same six conservatives last week also voted to uphold state bans on gender care for trans youths under age 18.

On the most closely watched cases since Trump retook office, arising as part of the justices’ annual session or on its emergency docket, the president’s legal team prevailed.

In his press conference on Friday after the ruling on his effort to end birthright citizenship, Trump thanked individual justices in the majority, saying of Barrett, “I just have great respect for her. I always have. And her decision was brilliantly written today – from all accounts.”

(Trump previously criticized Barrett behind closed doors for not sufficiently supporting his legal positions.)

The high court’s embrace of Trump’s legal positions contrasts with a general resistance of lower court judges who in the early months of Trump’s second presidency have blocked dozens of his executive orders. Some judges have also commented about his larger quest for power.

“An American President is not a king,” one Washington, DC-based US district court judge wrote in an early challenge to Trump.

Friday’s ruling, combined with a decision last year that gave the president substantial immunity from prosecution, amplifies the power of the American presidency more than ever.

“The other shoe has dropped on executive immunity,” Sotomayor said as she read excerpts of her dissent from the bench Friday.

Dueling statements from the bench

When the justices opened their final session at 10 a.m. Friday, they had six cases yet to be resolved in the term that had begun last October. Because the Trump dispute was widely seen as the most significant of the batch, it was easy to presume that Roberts or another senior justice would be the author. And that would mean – because the justices announce their daily decisions in order of reverse seniority – the opinion would come later in the hour.

But that presumption was immediately disproved when Roberts, who controls most assignments, announced at the outset that Barrett was the author of Trump v. CASA.

Trump’s third appointee from his first White House term, Barrett is the most junior justice of the six-member right-wing bloc. Rarely would a junior justice gain a case of such import, and the move appeared be a sign of Roberts’ confidence in Barrett and likely desire to continue working in tandem with a justice who has at times straddled the middle and controlled the outcome of cases. (The others who voted in the majority on Friday were Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.)

Friday’s controversy traced to January 20, Trump’s first day back in office, as he rejected the entrenched understanding of the citizenship clause and proposed to exclude from automatic citizenship babies born of parents in the country unlawfully or on temporary visas, such as tourists or students.

Several lower court judges blocked enforcement of the order, on preliminary findings that it was unconstitutional, and the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court. The administration did not seek a decision on the constitutionality of the order proposing to deny passports and other documents to children born to people without citizenship.

Rather, it wanted the high court to declare that US district court judges lacked the power to issue sweeping “universal injunctions” against Trump policies as they were litigated. Such injunctions have been invoked to block a challenged policy not just as it would be applied to the parties in a case but to prohibit its enforcement throughout the country.

In recent decades, US district court judges have increasingly applied such injunctions to prevent – on a preliminary basis – arguably unconstitutional policies from being enforced while the merits of legal challenges are resolved.

Seated at her usual place on the bench, to Robert’s far right, Barrett said the judges who had imposed the nationwide injunctions in the birthright citizenship cases had exceeded their authority.

Looking to 1789 and the power first conferred on federal courts, she described judges’ authority in such disputes over presidential action as “flexible … not freewheeling.”

“Some say that the universal injunction ‘give(s) the Judiciary a powerful tool to check the Executive Branch,’” she elaborated in her written opinion. “But federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch; they resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given them. When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too.”

As Barrett spoke in the courtroom, detailing arguments in her usual composed, professorial style, most of her colleagues looked out at the hushed spectators and betrayed no reaction.

But as Barrett finished her announcement, Sotomayor voiced her objections – and passionately. As she began to read excerpts from her dissent, the senior-most liberal justice pulled her chair up closer at the mahogany bench and leaned forward.

She spoke for 20 minutes, twice as long as Barrett. (Dissenting justices typically leave their protest to their written statements; an oral dissent from the bench is used to convey a more urgent opposition to the majority’s position.)

Normally, Justice Gorsuch is in the seat between Barrett and Sotomayor, but he was not on the bench Friday. So, as Sotomayor spoke, she was in Barrett’s direct line of sight. Barrett’s jaw was set as she listened intently to the dissenting justice condemn the majority for a decision that “kneecaps the judiciary’s authority” to stop the president from acting unconstitutionally.

And as Barrett asserted that the justices were not addressing the merits of Trump’s ability to outright lift birthright citizenship, Sotomayor deliberately put the focus on that drive to undo a principle dating to America’s founding.

Sotomayor referred to the notorious 1857 case of Dred Scott v. Sandford, in which the Supreme Court had held that Black people could not be citizens, and noted that the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, remedied that court action. (The citizenship clause of the amendment says, “all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and the State wherein they reside.”)

Speaking broadly about the new unchecked freedom a president would now experience, Sotomayor declared, “No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates.”

Barrett and the other justices in the majority were plainly unmoved by arguments from the dissent. In fact, the liberal justices made few inroads in major cases in the recent session, especially when they involved Trump policies.

Sotomayor, joined by liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, have been blunt in their disdain not only of the administration but their conservative colleagues who’ve enabled it.

They contend the majority’s decisions have encouraged the administration to defy lower court orders, as in last Monday’s case siding with the Trump administration as it rushes to deport certain migrants to countries other than their homeland, including places like South Sudan.

“This is not the first time the Court closes its eyes to noncompliance, nor, I fear, will it be the last,” dissenting Sotomayor wrote, joined by the two other liberals. “Yet each time this Court rewards noncompliance with discretionary relief, it further erodes respect for courts and for the rule of law.”

6-3 conservative majority dominates

There were some early signs of compromise on Trump’s aggressive immigration policy, notably under the wartime Alien Enemies Act. And even some conservatives questioned whether the administration would abide by mounting lower court orders.

In May 15 oral arguments over enforcement of the Trump birthright order, Barrett queried US Solicitor General D. John Sauer, Trump’s top lawyer before the Supreme Court, regarding his suggestion that the administration might not be bound by all court orders.

“There are circumstances when it is not a categorical practice,” he said, referring to lower court rulings.

“Really?” Barrett said but then, seemingly trying to win assurance of regard for judicial orders, pivoted to a hypothetical scenario involving the high court itself.

“You would respect the opinions and judgment of the Supreme Court,” she asked. “You’re not hedging at all with respect to the precedent of this court?”

“That is correct,” Sauer said.

For his part, Roberts, who has long championed an expansive theory of executive authority, has given the administration positions the benefit of the doubt – even as he has seemed apprehensive of the chief executive himself.

In March, after Trump declared in a social media post that a federal judge handling a migrant deportation case “should be IMPEACHED,” Roberts issued a statement implicitly rebuking him. “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”

But that that was three months and many court decisions ago. And in the meantime, a 6-3 split, with the chief justice leading and Barrett at his side, has taken hold, exemplified in Friday’s decision.

At his press conference afterward, Trump was bursting with praise.

He recognized each justice in the majority by name: “I want to thank Justice Barrett, who wrote the opinion brilliantly, as well as Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Thomas – great people.”"
left_lean,"I'm not sure if it's mom guilt or my pride, but ever since I became a mother 14 years ago, I wanted to be my kids' go-to mentor. If one of my daughters was sad, I wanted to be the one who held her until she calmed down.

If my child had a rough day at school, I wanted to be the person who bent down to meet her eyes and ask her about it. When one of my girls had a preteen tiff with friends, I wanted to be the one who offered guidance.

I'm their mother. I wanted it to be me — if not all of the time, at least most of the time.

Even though my kids have a wonderful father who is also there for them, as a mom of two daughters, I wanted to make sure that I was the woman who dried their tears, listened to their dilemmas, and offered sound advice.

I wasn't wrong to feel this way; that's my job, and being there for those moments showed my daughters how much I love them. I wanted them to know they can always count on my presence and support. Recently, though, I've learned that I don't have to be the only woman on whom they rely for these things. Sometimes, another woman who loves them might even be a better choice.

Living with my mom and sister has shown me it's OK to let them help out

Three months ago, we moved in with my mom and older sister while we renovate our home. We're there every day — when my kids are in good moods and bad moods, when they don't want to do homework, when they're fighting with friends. I've done what I always do, offering my ear and my guidance.

But I've learned that it's OK to allow others who love my kids to help out. My mother found my younger daughter lying on her bed, feeling sad, and she sat down beside her. She listened while she rubbed my daughter's back and then, she shared advice. Other times, when my younger daughter was moody and resistant to homework or bedtime, my sister stepped in and found a way to convince her, making her laugh with a joke or slipping in some fun.

They're doing the job I thought had to be only mine, and they're doing it well.

This is even more true when I think about my older daughter, who is now a teenager. Sometimes, she just doesn't want to talk to me simply because I'm her mother. She gets tired of hearing my input, but she will go to her aunt to discuss her troubles — she will even listen to her advice. Occasionally, she might also talk to her grandmother about something before she talks to me about it. And that's OK, because at least I know she's getting the guidance she needs.

I've accepted I'm not always their top choice

It's not easy to accept; I still want to be her top choice. Occasionally, I still am, and I hope when we get through all this teenage angst, she'll come to me even more often. But for now, I have to admit that these other women who love her are just the better option sometimes.

I have to remind myself how blessed I am that I have plenty of women around us who I trust to comfort my kids, listen to their troubles, and give them advice. At the end of the day, my job is to do what's best for my children. If, now and then, that best thing is not me, so be it. None of this will change how much they love me. And no matter who they choose as a mentor, I know they'll always know how very much I love them."
left_lean,"President Donald Trump is using false claims to promote his massive domestic policy bill.

In a White House speech on Thursday, Trump falsely claimed Medicaid is “left the same” by the bill. In fact, both the version of the legislation that was narrowly passed by the House in May and the latest version now being contemplated by the Senate contain major Medicaid policy changes and funding cuts that are expected to result in millions of people losing insurance coverage.

Trump also falsely claimed that the bill includes “no tax” on Social Security benefits. The legislation would not actually fulfill Trump’s campaign promise to completely eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, though it would temporarily give seniors a substantially bigger tax deduction. And Trump falsely claimed that “there’ll be a 68% tax increase” if Congress doesn’t approve the bill; there is no credible estimate of anything close to a 68% hike.

One caveat: since Congress has not yet sent a final bill to Trump’s desk, it’s possible that legislators will make major changes before the Senate votes. But Trump’s claims are inaccurate with regard to the House-approved version and the version senators are considering.

Asked for comment on the president’s false claims, the White House provided an on-record response that touted the benefits of the bill but did not defend Trump’s specific assertions.

“The One, Big, Beautiful Bill is chock-full of the policies that the American people elected President Trump – and Congressional Republicans – to implement,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a Friday email.

Here is a fact check.

The bill and Medicaid

Trump claimed in his Thursday address that people are “not going to feel any” of the spending cuts included in the bill. He then said, “Your Medicaid is left alone. It’s left the same.”

Facts First: Trump’s claim about Medicaid is false. The version of the bill that was passed by the House last month would make multiple significant changes to Medicaid and would reduce federal funding for the program by hundreds of billions of dollars. The legislation’s Medicaid provisions are expected to result in 7.8 million more people being uninsured in 2034, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

Medicaid provides health insurance coverage to more than 71 million low-income Americans, including children, people with disabilities, senior citizens, parents and other adults.

The House bill would require certain able-bodied adults without dependent children to work, volunteer or participate in other activities for at least 80 hours a month to retain their coverage. It would also enact several provisions that would make it more difficult to sign up for or reenroll in Medicaid. And it would reduce federal support to certain states that provide state-funded coverage to undocumented immigrants.

Regardless of the merits of these policies, they are major changes that would not leave Medicaid “the same.” All told, the changes would reduce federal support for the program by roughly $800 billion over a decade, the Congressional Budget Office projects; the Senate version of the bill has yet to be finalized but contains many similar provisions.

Asked for comment on Trump’s claim that Medicaid would be “left the same” by the bill, a White House official provided background material that did not try to corroborate the claim. Rather, the White House defended the bill’s proposed changes to Medicaid – saying, for example, that the majority of people the Congressional Budget Office estimated would lose Medicaid under the bill “are able-bodied adults between the ages of 19 and 64 who have no dependents and work less than 20 hours per week.”

The bill and Social Security

Trump campaigned in 2024 on a promise of no more taxes on Social Security benefits. On Thursday, he said the bill is “so good” because it includes “hundreds of things” that will benefit Americans – including “no tax” on Social Security. He then said in a social media post on Friday that the legislation left Republicans “on the precipice” of delivering achievements including “NO TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY FOR OUR SENIORS.”

Facts First: Trump’s claim about Social Security is false. The bill would temporarily beef up seniors’ standard tax deduction, but it would not completely eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits.

The House-approved version would give people age 65 and older a $4,000 increase to their standard deduction from 2025 through 2028, whether or not they are receiving Social Security payments yet. The Senate version would provide a $6,000 boost to seniors. In both versions, the benefit would start to phase out for individuals with incomes of more than $75,000 and couples with incomes of more than $150,000.

This measure is a move in the direction of Trump’s campaign promise to end taxes on Social Security benefits; lawmakers could not eliminate those taxes under the rules of budget reconciliation, which Republicans are using to advance the package by a simple majority vote and without Democratic support in the Senate. But whatever the reason, Trump’s claim that the bill includes “no tax” on Social Security, period, remains incorrect.

Asked for comment on the Trump claim, the White House asserted in its background material that, under the bill, the vast majority of seniors receiving Social Security income would pay no tax on that income. Trump’s own assertion was bigger.

The bill and taxes

Trump warned Thursday of the consequences of allowing the temporary tax cuts from his 2017 tax law to expire rather than making them permanent by passing this new bill – and he invoked a figure he has frequently deployed when promoting the 2025 legislation.

“If the bill doesn’t pass, there’ll be a 68% tax increase,” he said. “Think of that: 68%.”

Trump again repeated the “68%” warning during Friday remarks at the White House.

Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. There is no credible basis for the claim that failing to pass the bill would result in anywhere near a 68% tax increase. One analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank found that taxes would rise by an average of about 7.5% in 2026 if Trump’s bill didn’t pass. Asked for comment by CNN, the White House did not attempt to address the “68%” figure even on condition of anonymity; it also provided no comment to other fact-checkers earlier in the month.

In their articles, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org noted that it’s possible Trump has been wrongly describing a different Tax Policy Center estimate. The think tank found that about 64% of households would pay more taxes in 2026 if the 2017 law’s temporary cuts in individual income tax and the estate tax were allowed to expire.

That’s clearly not the same as saying Americans will face a 64% (or 68%) tax increase. And this wasn’t a one-time slip of the tongue by the president."

In my mid-30s, I still couldn't afford to live alone in the US. I was sharing an 1,800-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath house in Nevada with a roommate, spending $3,300 to $5,000 on my monthly bills.

As a writer and university adjunct English professor, I earned less than $2,000 a month and cleaned houses in my spare time to cover the rest. This left little time to realize my dream of writing a book.

I realized couldn't achieve my goal in the US; the cost of living was simply too high. It was time for a change.

I'd spent time in Europe while earning my Master's degree in London. On weekends I'd travel to France with friends and had seen how the cost of living could be much cheaper there.

So, when I had the opportunity to continue to teach online and increase my freelance writing work, moving to France felt like the best way to cut costs.

In France, my place was smaller but was everything I wanted

I moved into an apartment in a small city about 40 minutes by train from Paris.

It's everything I wanted, and my rent was cheaper — €650 (about $740), including utilities. I was finally saving money.

Plus, it felt like a dream to write on my couch with my neighbor's violet blooming wisteria visible through my white-curtained French windows framed by ancient wooden beams.

While my French apartment was certainly smaller — only 104 sq. ft. — than the space I had in the US, the layout was better.

Blending the kitchen and living room, the vaulted ceilings enabled a spacious bedroom loft with a skylit window and enough space for a reading chair.

While I sacrificed five times the kitchen counter space I had in Nevada, the whole kitchen took me only 10 minutes to clean, saving me hours a week.

I slashed my monthly expenses

In France, I saved anywhere from $1,700 to $3,200 a month on expenses, and I typically spent $1,600 to $1,800 a month to cover all my living costs, including rent.

A lot of my savings came from cheaper rent and no longer having a car. I paid $20 a month to store my car in the US and no longer spent the $475 a month it cost in gas and insurance.

If I wanted to go somewhere in France, I used public transportation, which costs about €50 to €80 ($57 to $91) a month.

I could afford to slow down and still save on dining out

A small town south of Paris. Courtesy of Alice Hafer

French bakeries offered pain au chocolat (chocolate croissants) for €1.80 ($2.09), while delicious dinners like boeuf bourguignon ranged from €12 to €17 ($13 to $18), a bargain next to my favorite $25 twelve-inch pizza in Nevada.

A glass of house wine back home could cost $12 to $15. Most brasseries, a sophisticated version of a cheap bar, have happy hours starting at 5 p.m., where a glass of wine often cost €5 ($5.80).

My life naturally slowed down as I delighted in spending hours with friends unbothered, knowing the evening would only dent my pocket a little.

I was finally free to finish my book

Even though I worked remotely, I slowed down my lifestyle by syncing my rhythm with the numerous French holidays when I could, and scaled down to 30 hours a week to add time to work on my book.

In France, the pressure to grind had less of a draw. I saved more than time and money by embracing the French lifestyle of ""joie de vivre,"" which encourages enjoyment over expense.

The shift in mindset empowered me to finally focus on self-enrichment and my creative goals rather than chasing a lavish American lifestyle.

The lack of financial pressure lowered my stress and granted me the extra time I needed to complete the final draft of my book."

Like many pandemic graduates, my young adult life started not with a bang, but with a whimper.

There was no big celebration, just a diploma picked up from the school office and a new job as an associate editor at a Charlotte-based digital media company.

I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill in December 2020. My lease, signed with four housemates, ran until the following summer. For the first half of 2021, I worked remotely in the same house I'd lived in during my first semester of senior year. Professional life wasn't much different from my life as a student, but I was content.

When the lease ended, I was faced with three choices: move to Charlotte in anticipation of when my workplace returned to in-person work, find new housing in Chapel Hill, or move back home.

At that time, COVID vaccines had been rolled out, but the pandemic wasn't over. I didn't want to move to a new city under those circumstances. With most of my friends leaving Chapel Hill, staying felt pointless. Moving home was the cheapest and easiest option. I took it.

The savings added up, but I was languishing

I moved into my old room and shared meals with my parents, just like I'd done before college. I worked from home, writing and editing articles about personal finance.

My parents didn't charge me for rent or food. But, I helped out around the house and covered any personal expenses, like my phone bill and miscellaneous purchases.

With no rent or bills, and student loan payments paused due to COVID, I saved roughly three-quarters of my income. I invested some of that money and kept the rest in a high-yield savings account.

But while my savings grew, my personal life languished. My parents were loving but often treated me like the kid I used to be, not the adult I'd become. After four years of independence during college, that was hard for me to adjust to.

I was also lonely. St. Louis was my hometown, but I had no community there. My friends were scattered across the country, and pandemic restrictions made it hard to meet new people.

I knew I didn't want to stay in St. Louis long-term. Building a life there felt pointless since I planned to leave once the pandemic ended, but I didn't know when that would be.

Moving to Charlotte was the fresh start I needed

After eight months of limbo, I finally found the motivation to leave home when my workplace reopened for hybrid work. With my parents' support, I moved to Charlotte in February 2022.

When I left home, I had about $15,000 saved. That money was invaluable in kickstarting my new life, which came with a surprising amount of upfront costs.

I had no problem paying for my apartment's security deposit and first month's rent. When I couldn't find a suitable car due to the 2022 car shortage, I could up my budget and keep the monthly payment manageable with a higher down payment. I felt comfortable buying supplies for the apartment without second-guessing every expense. I even had several thousand dollars left over for an emergency fund.

I didn't spend extravagantly, but it was incredibly freeing to know I could pay for the things I needed — now and in the future, thanks to my emergency fund — without going into debt.

Starting my young adult life without credit card debt and with a financial buffer made everything less stressful.

Was it worth it?

I'm incredibly privileged — and grateful to my parents — to have had the choice to return home while working full-time. Not everyone has the chance, and not everyone has the choice. I was also lucky to land a job upon graduation, a privilege many pandemic graduates didn't have.

But was moving home worth it?

From my personal finance journalist's perspective, unequivocally yes. The money I saved set me up for long-term financial stability and made my first year in Charlotte so much easier.

From a personal perspective, it's complicated. Those months at home weren't exactly the happiest time, but I don't regret them. They taught me that in order to build a life that made me happy, I needed to stop taking the cheap and easy way out.

The year after I moved to Charlotte was one of the best in my life. My expenses ballooned, but I had freedom, community, and a better relationship with my parents despite the distance — all things worth more to me than money."

The 27-year-old had a fever on Thursday evening and was taken to the hospital on Friday when her condition did not improve, according to Tomé.

“She is the first to authorize me to say this and the first who wants it to be said: she has viral meningitis,” Tomé said in a press conference Friday following Spain’s 3-1 friendly victory over Japan, which Bonmatí missed.

“The word is definitely scary, but the doctor tells me it is under control,” she continued. “We don’t know the timeframe, we don’t know anything else.”

On Friday night, Bonmatí posted a picture of herself watching the game against Japan from a hospital bed, with a cannula in her arm.

The midfielder is widely considered to have been the best player in women’s soccer over the past few years, having been awarded the Ballon d’Or Féminin in both 2023 and 2024.

Bonmatí has played a crucial role in the Barcelona team, which has reached five consecutive Women’s Champions League finals, winning three. She also has 30 goals in 78 games for her country.

The Women’s Euros begin in Switzerland on Wednesday when Iceland faces Finland. Spain, the reigning world champion, will play its first game of the tournament against Portugal on Thursday evening.

Should Bonmatí remain absent from the team, it appears likely that 18-year-old Vicky López will take her place in the starting XI, having filled in for her in the game against Japan.

La Roja has never made it past the semifinals of this competition. The team was knocked out by eventual winner England in the quarterfinals in 2022 after fellow two-time Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas tore her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) three days before the start of the tournament.

Meningitis is a swelling of the protective membranes which cover the brain and spinal cord. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the disease can be very serious, but most people with mild viral meningitis recover with seven to 10 days without the need for treatment."
left_lean,"Questions remain over the true damage to Iran’s nuclear program. But as conflicting comments and reports come in from the Trump Administration and Pentagon intelligence estimates, one thing is certain: Trump’s failed diplomacy got us in this mess. I should know. Ten years ago, I was in Vienna as part of the U.S. team negotiating a deal to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Those negotiations culminated in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). It was Trump’s decision in 2018 to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal that ultimately led to the perilous situation in the Middle East today.

 

The JCPOA was the result of a sustained campaign of principled, effective U.S. diplomacy. President Obama began laying groundwork for this nuclear deal as soon as he came to office in 2009. His view—shared then and now across the U.S. political spectrum—was that the U.S. cannot accept a nuclear-armed Iran. At the time, Iran claimed that its nuclear energy program was for exclusively peaceful uses. Yet given evidence of Iran’s past interest in possessing a nuclear bomb prior to 2003, the U.S. could not take this claim at face value. To get the nuclear deal, Obama and his national security team rallied the world to increase pressure on Tehran. The U.S., E.U., and other allies put in place punishing sanctions. The U.N. Security Council followed suit with a fresh round of sanctions in June 2010 that were wide-ranging and targeted the nuclear program. These sanctions worked: they convinced Iran to come to the negotiating table. To iron out the technical provisions of a deal, the U.S. then put together a team of top career diplomats, nuclear scientists, lawyers, and sanctions experts. It was a remarkable lineup of American patriots and professionals. It was my great honor to serve on that team.



Our goal was to offer Iran phased and reversible sanctions relief in exchange for far-reaching limits on Iran’s nuclear activities. To maximize leverage, we coordinated with other countries, including not just European allies but also Russia and China. It was difficult, exacting, high-stakes work—for months on end. The effort paid off. Iran agreed to substantial limits on its nuclear activities, including to export out of the country around 98% of its enriched uranium stockpile. Iran’s commitments were then subject to intrusive and permanent international monitoring. By the end of the Obama Administration, the deal was working, with all sides implementing their commitments. Trump’s abrupt withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018 led to the predictable result: Iran’s nuclear program surged ahead, breaking free of the deal’s constraints. When Trump returned to office in January, he launched a hasty effort to negotiate a new deal. But it bore a striking resemblance to the deal negotiated by Obama, with one nuclear expert calling the Trump framework a “dollar store JCPOA.”



Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu tanked these talks with airstrikes on June 12. The U.S. launched its own strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22. Trump seems convinced the matter is now resolved. But what will be the fate of the tons of enriched uranium that Iran stockpiled after Trump withdrew from the JCPOA? How much Iranian nuclear infrastructure remains intact? Will Iran ever welcome back intrusive international monitoring of its nuclear activities, such as specified in the JCPOA? To resolve these questions, the Trump Administration will need to do the tedious, difficult work of pursuing complex negotiations. Talks look set to resume next week. But it will require a high level of technical expertise and diplomatic capacity. And the timing couldn’t be worse, as Trump and Elon Musk’s culture war on the so-called “Deep State” has hollowed out and demoralized the ranks of government experts whose support was critical to achieving the JCPOA in the first place.



This sad saga has reminded me of what we’ve lost in the Trump era. The JCPOA was a product of effective and principled American diplomacy, undertaken in close coordination with our closest allies. It was a team effort by countless government professionals and specialists, all motivated by patriotism and a sense of mission, and operating in an era where they were celebrated not denigrated. It was a victory of dialogue and diplomacy over bluster and bombs.

Ten years ago that approach delivered results for the American people and the world. I worry about what comes next."

Mark Zuckerberg is showing off wrist candy from his pricey watch collection in his everyday looks.

After years of dressing in humble hoodies, the billionaire has beefed up his wardrobe with a custom gold chain and a collection of luxury watch brands. Zuckerberg, who Forbes estimates is worth nearly $250 billion, recently paired a basic T-shirt with a limited-edition watch. An iteration of the same model sold at auction for $254,000 in April, Sotheby's said.

Zuckerberg's F.P. Journe Chronomètre Bleu Byblos is one of 99 of that model made in 2014 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the watchmaker's boutique in Beirut. Watch industry veterans identified the timepiece after Zuckerberg wore it during an April 28 appearance on Theo Von's ""This Past Weekend"" podcast.

""It's one of those pieces that quietly signals, 'I know what I'm wearing,' without shouting it,"" Eugene Tutunikov, CEO of SwissWatchExpo, told Business Insider.

The F.P. Journe Chronomètre Bleu Byblos originally sold for under $25,000. F.P. Journe

Zuckerberg has other F.P. Journe watches in his collection. For his keynote at Meta Connect 2024, he chose a watch that resembled one from the Souveraine collection. Sotheby's estimated that it could fetch up to $54,000 at auction.

""F.P. Journe is one of the most respected independent watchmakers, celebrated for its superb finishing, innovation, and incredibly limited runs,"" Paul Altieri of Bob's Watches told BI.

Despite the rarity and hefty price tag, the Chronomètre Bleu Byblos is a ""simpler"" time-only choice for the Meta CEO compared to the more complicated pieces he's been spotted in, Joshua Ganjei, CEO of European Watch Company, said.

Zuck wasn't known for flashy fashion choices when he broke onto the tech scene as a college dropout. Over the years, his zip-up hoodie and blue sweater became a staple of his style.

Last year, he was captured admiring a Richard Mille watch worn by the Reliance Industries heir Anant Ambani.

""You know, I never really wanted to get a watch, but after seeing that, I was like, watches are cool,"" Zuckerberg is heard saying in a video of the interaction.

Today, he's turned a corner to crank up his style. His custom gold chain — made in honor of his daughters — is paired with many of his outfits, and he's rarely seen without a pair of the Ray-Ban smart glasses powered by Meta AI.

Meta didn't immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider.

Adam Mosseri, CEO of Instagram, previously praised Zuckerberg's new steeze in June 2024. Mosseri said his boss spent a long time ""not wasting any energy on deciding what to wear."" Instead, Zuckerberg decided to wear ""the same thing every day for a long time as a lot of tech execs have done.""

Zuck is entering a new fashion era in his own way, with a watch that's a ""perfect fit"" for him, Tutunikov said.

""It's almost like the thinking man's grail: no flashy logos, no gimmicks, just insane craftsmanship and a bit of mystery,"" he said."

Inside a billionaire's Venetian vows

We're all just nosy, huh? It's why the world has been watching as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former newscaster turned philanthropist Lauren Sánchez got married in a not-so-private event spanning three days in Venice.

""This magical place has gifted us unforgettable memories,"" Bezos and Sánchez, who met in 2019 and got engaged in 2023, said on their wedding invitation about the floating city.

Some 200 guests were expected to attend the festivities in one of the most romantic cities in the world, the city said in a statement. And A-listers were spotted as they touched down, including Tom Brady, Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, and Ivanka Trump with Jared Kushner.

There's no telling how much the billionaire's wedding celebration will cost, but reported estimates range from $11.5 million to $35 million.

Luxury wedding planner and founder of Italian Knot, Roberta Camille Lione, told BI that although the latter figure feels a bit high, it's ""not impossible — especially if the couple is sparing no expense across accommodations, logistics, entertainment, and design.""

Still, not everyone is thrilled that Bezos and Sánchez have picked Venice for their wedding. Local protesters have erected signs across the city, including one that reads, ""No space for Bezos."" (Get it? Because he founded Blue Origin.) They've also said they plan to disrupt the nuptials.

However, Jessica Testoni, who runs a small souvenir stall in Venice, told our senior reporter on the ground, Joshua Nelken-Zitser, that she hopes it's not the last celebrity wedding to happen in her town. ""On this occasion, I'm happy Bezos and Sánchez are getting married here,"" she said. ""It helps businesses like mine.""

It's an interesting perspective given this behemoth of a wedding is happening during so much economic anxiety. That said, whether you're watching on purpose or by sheer force, despite the secretive nature of the nuptials, here's one thing we know for sure: this type of extravagance may only come once in a lifetime.

Seven successful men — from across industries including venture capital, equity research, and advertising — shared their morning rituals with BI, from running long distances to making latte art.

Most said they're early risers, waking up between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. Many said they started their days with exercise, though some shared creative habits like journaling.

Tea or coffee is essential.

For many people, luxury gyms have become more than just a gym. Popular franchises like Equinox or Life Time offer amenities that go beyond fitness, like complimentary childcare services, tidy workspaces, and sometimes, poolside bars.

Even if it takes extra saving or tight budgeting to afford a $200+ a month membership, these luxury gym goers say it's worth it.

More than a gym.

American homes look a lot different these days. Many newly built homes are not just pricier, but they're smaller, too. That doesn't mean buyers are sacrificing comfort and quality, though.

The National Association of Homebuilders surveyed 3,000 recent and prospective buyers and found four home trends shaping homebuying right now.

My Renault 5 E-Tech was very, very, very green. BI

It's the accessory you didn't know you needed: a baguette holder. Yes, the Renault 5 E-Tech has just such a feature in the passenger footwell — a gimmick, of course, but a brilliantly quirky touch nonetheless that reminds you you're driving a French voiture.

I was going to include a picture of an empty baguette holder, but then I found this one from the car's launch showing Olympic gold medal-winning British diver Tom Daley with an actual baguette in the holder instead.

You could also use the holder for a bunch of flowers, should you be so inclined.

As you might have guessed from the E, the revived 5 is indeed electric, and there is no gas equivalent. It came about after now-departing CEO Luca de Meo rashly promised in a speech that Renault could make a new car in just 24 months — a very tight timeline in the auto world — and managed to do so only a few weeks past that target.

The 5 made its debut way back in 1972 and was an instant hit, becoming the best-selling car in France for 14 years, with about 5.5 million vehicles sold during that period.

While it was available in the US in the late 1970s, as Le Car, it didn't exactly bewitch American drivers.

Souped-up versions appealed to boy racers, and a turbo model won the Monte Carlo Rally in 1981.

The new 5 is Europe's car of the year 2025, beating the Alfa Romeo Junior, Citroën C3-ëC3, Cupra Terramar, Dacia Duster, Hyundai Inster and Kia EV3. It was back-to-back wins for Renault, after the Scenic — a small MPV — took the crown last year.

To find out why the 5 won, I took a train on a very warm Friday afternoon earlier this month to the northern edge of London to pick up an R5. It had a 52kWh battery, 150 HP engine, and came in vibrant ""Pop! Green.""

Buying this car would set you back a shade under £27,000 ($36,300), and has a decent WLTP range of 251 miles. This configuration represents the best value for money, according to What Car? The range starts at about £23,000.

I hit the M40 motorway bound for the picturesque town of Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare. I was able to do the speed limit of 70 miles an hour for most of the journey and got there in about two hours.

As I failed to connect my iPhone to the audio system before setting off, I tuned into the top 40 singles countdown on BBC Radio 1 —Sabrina Carpenter ended Alex Warren's 12-week run at the top of the chart, by the way.

The audio system sounds superb — and was apparently created by Jean-Michel Jarre, the legendary French electronic music artist.

For a small-ish EV, the 5 packs a punch, doing the speed limit effortlessly with plenty in reserve, had I wanted to risk a speeding fine. I can't say it's the quietest car I've ever driven, but I can't fault the ride and handling.

As well as the baguette holder, there are plenty of charming/weird touches, such as the ""5"" battery indicator on the hood that lights up. It's part of the car's ""modern lighting signature with cheeky welcome and goodbye sequences,"" as Renault puts it.

The 5 is a lot of fun to drive — more than the quite boring MG I tested earlier this year. Not everyone may love its many quirks, such as the fabric on the dashboard and ceiling, and I found the four—yes, four—control stalks plus controls on the steering wheel to be quite bewildering.

Maybe I'm just easily confused, but I still failed to master the automatic transmission before having to give the car back. And I still have no idea what the ""Multi-Sense"" button does.

I found the automatic transmission on the Renault 5 somewhat baffling. Renault

I had about 50% left and didn't want to risk running out of charge on the trip back to London, so I found a charging station in a fairly dismal retail park in Banbury.

This was actually the first time I've charged an EV, and it took me a minute to work out the right plug (yes, I am a slow learner). Fortunately I didn't have to create an account to use the charger and could just tap my credit card to release the power.

Getting the charge up to about 80% took about 15 minutes and cost just over £15 (about $20). Public chargers are not that cheap in the UK, and had the car been close to flat, it would've set me back about £50 (almost $70) to reach 100% — not too much less than a tank of gas.

If you don't have a garage or driveway, the economics of an EV become considerably more complicated, which is one reason hybrids are becoming increasingly popular.

Charging the Renault 5 was reasonably painless. BI

In April, the 5 E-Tech was the UK's best-selling EV for retail buyers. In both April and May, it helped Renault take the top spot for private registrations of pure EVs. According to Renault, the car also leads its segment in Europe.

Car Dealer magazine also made the 5 its car of the year, calling it the ""right car at the right time.""

""The Renault 5 has both added some much-needed excitement to the lower end of the electric car market, and given Renault dealers some fire in their bellies. This small car is delivering a huge impact,"" says editor in chief James Baggott.

I'm inclined to agree. And you know what's coming now, don't you, American readers? It appears Renault has no plans to bring the 5 E-Tech to the US. Désolé."

Economists at Morgan Stanley think investors are about to be disappointed in the outcomes of the next two Federal Reserve meetings.

The bank said in a note on Friday that, despite a recent push from President Donald Trump and recent dovish talk from central bankers, the July and September FOMC meetings will result in no change to borrowing costs.

The Fed's cautious approach this year has sparked backlash from President Trump, who has said he believes interest rates need to be cut ""by at least 2-3 points.""

But since the last meeting, other top Fed officials have come out in support of rate cuts in July, with markets cheering the dovish talk.

But Morgan Stanley says don't count on it. Their thesis centers around two key points.

First, they expect that the economic data released in the short term will remain consistent with the ""wait and see approach"" displayed by Powell.

While the Fed chairman has reaffirmed a need to further assess the impact of tariffs, he has also recently raised concerns regarding the reliability of economic data.

""We expect firmer inflation prints showing more signs of a tariff push over the summer,"" the analysts note, adding that they also expect the coming employment report to be ""relatively solid,"" both of which are factors unlikely to push the Fed toward rate cuts.

They also highlight that despite the recent push from Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, the pro-rate-cut camp is relatively small.

""The Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) published last week revealed that there are seven policymakers who expect no cuts this year,"" the report states. ""In fact, the overall tone of Fed speakers this week was much more aligned with Chair Powell's.""

San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly and New York Fed president John Williams are examples of Fed officials who have taken a more hawkish approach to interest rates. Both have expressed sentiments similar to Powell's.

Morgan Stanley added that both Waller and Bowman's statements raised the probability of rate cuts to 20% in July and 60%-90% in September. The higher odds were cheered by markets during the week, with more dovish forecasts helping propel the S&P 500 to a new all-time high.

While Morgan Stanley's analysts note uncertainty remains high and that their predictions could be wrong, they maintain that firmer inflation prints will be coming later in the summer and will likely peak in July or August.

They add that their forecast is aligned with Powell's expectations, which include tariffs pushing prices higher in the coming months."

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Trae Cervantes, who worked as an engineering technician at Tesla until March 2025. It has been edited for length and clarity.

I started at Tesla's Gigafactory in Nevada as a production associate in 2018, and I worked my way into a role as an engineering technician. I held at least four different positions during my time at Tesla.

I was drawn to Tesla because I needed a way to improve my situation. Leading up to Tesla, I wasn't doing super well. I'd gone through a divorce, I got arrested for drinking and driving, and I was working two jobs to make ends meet. One of my best friends was working there and he told me to apply. When I got the job, I quit the two jobs and immediately got a better paying role with more time off.

The reason I stayed is because they kept treating me well. I was getting paid the most I'd ever gotten in my adult life. No education, no real skills to speak of, and Tesla offered me opportunities to take charge of my life and grow my career.

I started out on their production line for the Model 3 and I moved up from there. When I started out, it was grueling work. It was pushing heavy things up and down aisles. I was on my feet for 12 hours a day, but they also give you three to four days off a week to recover.

It was a physically demanding job, but it didn't bother me. I knew that if I demonstrated a good work ethic I could work my way up, and that's what I've done. Every few years I was able to move up, from production associate to technician to eventually lead and engineering roles.

A month into a new role, it was March 2020, and we were all furloughed. It was a big freak-out moment for me. Nobody was telling us what was going on, and I felt like I was going to lose my job. But we were back to work five weeks later and I learned to work around the new COVID safety standards.

I felt like I really took ownership of my area, and I eventually became a lead for that team. To do it, I really had to show my value — I had to leverage my skills and build the relationships and rapport. That's what you have to do at Tesla — the skills aren't enough, you also need the relationships, and you need to show you can pick up the slack because things are always changing there.

In 2023, they provided me an opportunity to go to school through a program at a local community college. They helped me get a certificate in advanced manufacturing. I took nine courses between January and May, all while I was still doing my normal duties, and I even made the Dean's list. Later on I got another certificate, a green belt certification for Lean Six Sigma.

'A cult of personality around Elon'

I never drank the Elon Musk Kool Aid.

When I started at my orientation, they talked about his controversial tweets. They said it's gotten him in hot water with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but they were mostly joking about it, like his behavior was okay because of who he was, what he does, or however much he's worth.

There's always been that kind of mindset at Tesla, a cult of personality around Elon. I remember when he smoked weed on the Joe Rogan Experience, seeing so many T-shirts referencing it at the Gigafactory.

I'd thought some of the things he'd done were wrong, like the Thai diver incident, but I believed in the mission. Then all of a sudden, he jumped into a capacity where he could impact my daily life.

His involvement in Twitter, his involvement in the election, all of that was detracting from the company's mission. I didn't realize how much it mattered to me until the last couple of months.

Emily Najera for BI

When Musk started throwing his money around in politics — that was a big thing for me. What I took issue with the most was the giveaway for prospective voters. It seemed so morally wrong. I didn't want to be associated with that.

I started actively looking into his history, and the company's. The stock price and how we're making money — none of it made sense to me. That was another reason I wanted to get out. There are a lot of empty promises that haven't been fulfilled, like Full Self-Driving or the lower-cost EV.

When I first left, I gave myself a hard time

When he lifted his arm and did that Nazi salute, I was disgusted. (Editor's note: While discussing the incident with Joe Rogan, Musk said, ""Hopefully, people realize I'm not a Nazi."") Last year, I started to be ashamed to tell people where I work.

I chatted with a couple of folks at Tesla and I explained to them why I believed that that was a Nazi salute, and most of the time they just heard me out.

Near the end of my time at Tesla, I started bringing up politics because I'd kind of got to a point where I didn't really care. I started working on my resumé.

I spoke with my wife, my very close friends, and I explained the reason I wanted to leave. My wife just wants me to be happy. A lot of my friends are really, really pissed off at Musk, just like I am. They were all excited for me to leave the company. I have a pretty good support system.

I changed my profile on Teams to a meme of Musk. I resigned that day.

When I first left, I gave myself a hard time. I didn't have a job lined up, and I could have stayed longer or waited to get laid off and gotten severance at least. But then I started thinking about the layoffs last April, and I remember sitting in the building, seeing people send out text messages and Teams messages and wondering if they had a job. There were people who didn't find out until they got to the security gate at the factory. Why would I want to go through that?

Between that and then the day when Trump bought a Tesla on the White House lawn, which happened the same day I gave my resignation notice, I felt more resolute in my decision.

When I met with my supervisor and put in my notice, I told him, ""I have to leave. I can't do this anymore. It's getting to a point where I feel like I'm compromising myself morally by walking through those doors every day.""

I'm not going to lie, I cried a little. Seven years is a long time and Tesla wasn't always a bad thing for me.

What I would tell people is, if you're sitting in my shoes, and you feel uncomfortable, go for it. Do what you think will help you sleep at night.

There are plenty of good people at Tesla. I didn't leave the place because of the company. I left because of the face of the company.

In December, Rep. Thomas Massie used an analogy for foreign aid that was an instant hit among his libertarian and America-First Republican fans.

""US foreign aid spending is like watering the neighbor's yard while your house is on fire,"" the Kentucky Republican posted on X, adding a fire emoji.  wrote an article about it, and two months later, the libertarian student group ""Young Americans for Liberty"" turned it into an Instagram post.

As it turns out, Massie didn't come up with the line himself. Grok did.

Massie told BI this month that he ripped the phrase from a speech he asked the xAI-developed chatbot to generate using his voice. He said he's done this more than once.

""Out of five paragraphs, I'll find one sentence that's good,"" Massie said. ""But it makes it worth doing.""

Leaning on AI for speechwriting is an apparently bipartisan affair on Capitol Hill. ""I'll type in some phrases and say, can we make this more punchy?"" Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California told BI, adding that he began using ChatGPT ""almost like an editor"" in the last year.

""There was some speech I gave where it edited in a couple of lines that people thought, 'Wow, that's really good,'"" Khanna said.

Congress has developed a reputation for lagging behind the public when it comes to adopting new technology. Plenty of lawmakers told BI that they have yet to get into using AI, either because they're skeptical that it will be useful for them or they just haven't gotten around to it.

But several lawmakers have begun to casually adopt the technology, most often as a search engine and research tool. Khanna said he uses both ChatGPT and Grok, turning to the technology ""two to three times per day."" Massie, who uses Grok because of its convenient placement within the X app, said he uses the chatbot for ""anything.""

'Impressively good at certain things and pretty miserable at some things'

As Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin has waged a fight to make deeper cuts to federal spending as part of the ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" he's been consulting with Grok.

""I got up at 3 o'clock in the morning with an idea to use it,"" the Wisconsin Republican told BI in early June. He said the technology's been useful for running the numbers on the bill's impact on the deficit and to find documents that support his arguments. ""It's really great at identifying sources without me having to crawl around in government forms.""

In some ways, members of Congress are just doing what other Americans are doing. More and more people are using AI at work, according to a recent Gallup poll, with 40% of employees saying they use it a few times per year. Another 19% say they use it frequently, while 8% say they use it on a daily basis.

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a champion of a controversial provision in the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" that would restrict state's ability to regulate AI for 10 years, told BI that while he ""would not claim to be a sophisticated AI user,"" he's been using ChatGPT as an ""enhanced search engine.""

Cruz said he recently asked an AI chatbot about his own record, when he ""could not remember when I had first taken a public position"" on a particular policy area.

""It gave a very thorough answer, going back to an interview I'd done in 2012 and a comment I'd made in 2014,"" Cruz said. ""That research previously would have required some staff assistance, spending hours and hours, and you still wouldn't have found anything.""

Large language models like ChatGPT and Grok are known to sometimes present false information as fact — known as ""hallucinating."" For Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, that's enough to discourage her from using it.

""It lies,"" Warren told BI. ""I've tried using it, and it gets things wrong that I already know the answer to. So when I see that, I've lost all confidence.""

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he's tried ChatGPT and has been disappointed by its apparent limitations, even when carrying out more basic tasks.

In one instance, Murphy said he asked ChatGPT to generate a list of his Democratic colleagues ordered alphabetically by first name, only for it to include retired senators.

""It seems to be impressively good at certain things and pretty miserable at some things,"" Murphy said.

Even those who are otherwise fans of the technology said they're aware that they could be getting fed incorrect information.

""My chief of staff has astutely warned me that AI is often confidently wrong,"" Johnson said. ""So you really have to be careful in how you phrase your questions.""

""It definitely hallucinates on you,"" Massie said. ""It told me there was a Total Wine and More in Ashland, Kentucky, and no such thing exists."""
left_lean,"With just a week and a half remaining of a 90-day pause on President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, the White House is running out of time to negotiate its long-promised trade deals that could bring some certainty to an increasingly uneasy economy.

But with just two trade frameworks inked and dozens to go before the July 9 deadline, that timeframe appears increasingly unlikely — just as America’s economy might be taking a turn for the worse.

For months, the Trump administration has said deals are imminent, working with 18 key partners to lower trade barriers while hundreds of other countries wait in line to get out from under the burden of higher tariffs. But the timeframe continues to shift.

“I’ve made all the deals,” Trump said in a Time interview in late April, saying trade negotiations with foreign partners were nearly complete. “I’ve made 200 deals.”

More than two weeks later, Trump acknowledged that hundreds or even dozens of deals aren’t possible on such a short timeframe — a point he reiterated Friday at a press briefing at the White House.

“You know, we have 200 countries,” Trump said. “We can’t do that. So at a certain point, over the next week and a half or so, or maybe before, we’re going to send out a letter. We talked to many of the countries, and we’re just going to tell them what they have to pay to do business in the United States. And it’s going to go very quickly.”

That notion of establishing new tariffs for countries that can’t or won’t reach a deal with the United States has been floating around for over two months, but the timeline keeps getting pushed back. On April 23, Trump said his administration would “set the tariff” for countries that fail to negotiate new terms in the following few weeks. On May 16, Trump said that “at a certain point, over the next two to three weeks … we’ll be telling people what they’ll be paying to do business in the United States.”

Meanwhile, the United States remains in active negotiations with its key trading partners. But those deals have been promised for months, too, with little to show for it. On June 11, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said a flood of deals was coming.

“You’re going to see deal after deal, they’re going to start coming next week and the week after and the week after. We’ve got them in the hopper,” he told CNBC. On Thursday, Lutnick told  10 deals would be announced imminently.

But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also said Thursday that “the deadline is not critical,” a point that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized to Fox Business on Friday: Bessent said he thinks trade negotiations could be “wrapped up” by Labor Day, providing a more relaxed framework for inking deals than the previously prescribed July 9 deadline.

Meanwhile, Trump made clear Friday that trade policy could continue to grow more aggressive. In a social media message Friday, he said that the United States was pulling out of trade talks with Canada because of its digital services tax and that the administration would set a new tariff for its northern neighbor within the next week.

And Bessent told CNBC Friday that about 20 countries could return to their “Liberation Day” tariff rate starting on July 9, while others would receive longer windows to negotiate. He didn’t name the countries that would receive the higher levies, but some nations’ tariffs were set as high as 50% before Trump hit pause.

“The idea that uncertainty will be resolved early this summer appears to be completely dead,” Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, told CNN. “This means tariff aggression is not dead. That’s probably not super surprising but some of us allowed ourselves moments of optimism.”

The economy may be starting to turn

The problem with the perpetually pushed-back tariff timetable is that the economy could really use some deals right about now.

After several months of strong economic news but incredibly weak consumer sentiment, America is starting to see those trends reverse: The vibes are on the rebound, but evidence is mounting that the economy is getting worse.

Consumer sentiment climbed 16% this month, the University of Michigan said in its latest survey released Friday. Although consumer sentiment remains weak, the stock market is at an all-time high, which could give Americans a confidence boost.

But that’s not translating into spending. Consumer spending unexpectedly fell in May for the first time since January, the Commerce Department reported Friday. In real terms, consumer spending has now fallen so far in 2025.

Inflation is ticking higher, job growth is slowing and retail sales are sinking. That’s a concern, because consumer spending makes up two-thirds of America’s economy.

“Households are anxious about what tariff-induced price hikes will do to their spending power, while concerns about the robustness of the jobs market are on the rise,” said James Knightley, chief US economist for ING, in a note to clients Friday. “Equity markets have recovered and are at all-time highs, but house prices nationally are starting to come under downward pressure.”

Many mainstream economists argue that the low inflation of the spring that helped boost consumer sentiment represents a calm before the summer storm, when they expect prices to rise as companies finish selling off inventories of products they had brought to the United States before Trump imposed tariffs. Friday’s inflation report showed that the changeover to higher-tariff goods may have already begun to happen.

“Higher prices from tariffs may be starting to work their way through the economy,” said Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer at Brave Eagle Wealth Management.

Although tax cuts from Trump’s sweeping domestic policy agenda could help mitigate higher prices from tariffs, Trump’s trade war continues to risk retaliation from American’s key trading partners. Higher tariffs from foreign countries could slow the US economy, risking a recession.

“Trading partners taking retaliatory action could have a lasting impact on US output and, accordingly, public finances,” said Michel Nies, an economist at Citi.

That’s why trade deals are so urgent: America’s economy remains strong, but cracks are forming. Tariffs are a big reason why. More delays will generate more uncertainty. And those good vibes could turn bad pretty quickly.

The 17-year-old was selected by the New York Islanders with the first overall pick in the 2025 NHL draft on Friday in Los Angeles.

An emotional Schaefer, a defenseman from the Ontario Hockey League’s Erie Otters, was greeted by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman on the stage at the Peacock Theater, and was presented with an Islanders sweater that included a breast cancer ribbon stitched onto the jersey.

Schaefer kissed the ribbon before breaking into tears with his father and brother in the crowd.

Schaefer said the ribbon was a “surprise” to him along with his mother’s initals being embroidered into the collar of the jersey.

“This is a high class organization,” Schaefer told reporters. “To do that for me, it means a lot – it goes a long way. A lot of people can say it’s just a ribbon but it means a lot for me.

“My mom is a big part of my life. And this jersey, I will hang up for sure. That ribbon has a little extra meaning to it.”

Schaefer also dealt with the deaths of the mother of his billet family and Otters owner Jim Waters in the last year.

Schaefer added that he misses “the person she was” the most when asked about his mother.

“She was always so happy,” Schaefer told the ESPN broadcast. “She’s gone through so much but the personality she had – cancer sucks and it’s not fun. She didn’t always feel the best but she was always the happiest in the family and always made us laugh and do anything for us.”

The Canadian is the Islanders’ fifth selection at first overall in franchise history, and the club’s first since 2009 when they drafted John Tavares.

Schaefer, a Stoney Creek, Ontario native, played 17 games with Erie last season, recording seven goals and 22 points before breaking his collarbone at the 2025 IIHF World Junior Championship with Team Canada in December.

He won a gold medal and served as team captain of Team Canada at the 2024 Hlinka Gretzky Cup and also won gold with Canada at the 2024 IIHF World Under-18 Championship.

Heartfelt tributes

Ahead of the draft, Schaefer showed off his draft day suit which featured a picture of his mother and her signature near his heart.

“That was the biggest thing to put on my heart. I always know she is with me in spirit,” Schaefer said.

Islander fans at the draft watch party at UBS Arena in Elmont, New York gave Schaefer an rousing ovation after he told the crowd the team will “beat” their crosstown rivals the New York Rangers “every time we play them.”

Schaefer becomes the fifth defenseman to be selected No. 1 overall in the last 25 years, the first since Owen Power by the Buffalo Sabres in 2021.

The Islanders made two other selections in Friday’s first round following a trade with the Montreal Canadiens earlier in the day – forward Victor Eklund and defenseman Kashawn Aitcheson.

The San Jose Sharks selected center Michael Misa with the second overall pick and the Chicago Blackhawks took Swedish forward Anton Frondell with the third pick.

The Anaheim Ducks picked center Roger McQueen at No. 10 overall and the 18-year-old Canadian immediately hopped onto a helicopter to go to Disneyland.

The wife of late NHL superstar Johnny Gaudreau, Meredith, announced the Columbus Blue Jackets’ first selection of defenseman Jackson Smith at pick 14.

Diversifying your portfolio is one of the most basic pieces of investing advice that financial planners emphasize, but 47-year-old Etienne Breton has generated a seven-figure net worth and potentially secured early retirement in doing the opposite: going all-in on shares of software company Palantir.

Up over 80% in 2025, Palantir is one of the hottest stocks in the market right now thanks to a combination of AI momentum, the Trump trade, and an army of bullish retail investors.

But Breton certainly isn't just chasing a recent trend. He started buying Palantir in late 2020, shortly after the company went public — and kept adding to his position even as the stock floundered through much of the early 2020s.

Now, his position has grown to 17,800 shares with another 2,000 on margin for a total investment value of almost $2.5 million, brokerage statements viewed by Business Insider show.

A single-stock strategy

Palantir is the only stock Breton owns.

""I tried to identify very extraordinary companies. I didn't want to diversify,"" Breton said.

Two decades prior to buying Palantir, Breton had dabbled in the stock market for a short period, but sold out after the 9/11-induced stock market plunge.

His reentry into the market during the pandemic was well-timed.

""I saw someone selling all of their stocks because of the crash, so I did the exact opposite and opened an account,"" Breton told Business Insider.

Breton quickly landed on Palantir after learning about the company from a YouTube video. As a technical expert at a manufacturing company, Breton was drawn to the company because Palantir's offerings seemed like they could solve many of the issues he was seeing at his job, such as data silos and supply chain difficulties.

In a leap of faith, Breton went all-in.

""I sold my real estate and put almost everything I had into the stock,"" he said. Breton began buying around $10 a share and continued building his position aggressively as the stock fell to as low as $6 in 2020.

Breton kept a running tally of his Palantir purchases on his garage wall.

By the time the share price returned to $10, it was mid-2023, and according to Breton, he held 10,000 shares at an average price of $8.83.

In April 2023, Palantir launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). It was the big break Breton had been waiting for. From there, the stock began to slowly rebound, eventually snowballing into the mega-cap tech giant it is today.

Palantir options

Since 2023, Breton has also engaged in a variety of options strategies to generate income on his underlying shares and continue buying Palantir.

""I began selling covered calls seriously, but not on my core position. I used margin to buy thousands more shares and sell aggressive covered calls using a ladder strategy,"" Breton said.

That means he borrowed money to buy more Palantir shares, then sold call options on the shares, collecting a cash premium in exchange for agreeing to sell the stock at a certain price in the future. Laddering, or spreading the contracts across different prices and expiration dates, helped Breton create a steady stream of income.

Now, Breton is still slowly adding to his Palantir position with the premiums he receives on his covered calls.

Breton's aware of the risk that comes with having much of his net worth tied up in Palantir, so he's also buying Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPs), which are options with expiry dates a year or more in the future. This strategy allows him to earn income on his underlying shares and still benefit from potential upside.

One contract he showed Business Insider indicated that he had sold a $185 call and a $130 put expiring in December 2027, while also buying a $45 protective put. This setup is known as a strangle with downside protection: As long as Palantir stays between $130 and $185 through December 2027, both of those sold options expire worthless, and he keeps the full premium.

If Palantir trades above $185, Breton would give up any additional upside beyond that. If Palantir stock plummets, the protective put caps his loss and allows him to sell his shares at a minimum of $45. Breton also collects an upfront premium for selling the options.

Breton doesn't have plans to sell the underlying Palantir shares, although he would be open to investing in a new stock with the money he earns on the premiums.

""I'm now planning my retirement, which is approaching much sooner than I ever expected,"" Breton said. But he's not too eager to walk away from work just yet.

""I have a nice career, so I don't want to stop all of that,"" he added. ""I'll just take my time and maybe explore some business projects."""

Whomever replaces Anna Wintour in running day-to-day operations at American Vogue will have some enormous stilettos to fill.

That's partly because Wintour, who's 75, has been at the job for nearly four decades and is a legend in the business. It's also because whoever comes next will report to her.

Wintour, who became Vogue's editor in chief in 1988, is giving up that role. However, she'll remain global editorial director at the magazine and chief content officer for its parent company, Condé Nast, the company said Thursday.

Taking on a senior role, similar to the one Wintour vacated at Vogue, is often challenging, especially when the predecessor remains on hand, leadership experts told Business Insider.

Incoming leaders are wise to signal that they want to make changes without abandoning what makes an organization work, said Kevin Groves, a professor of management at Pepperdine's Graziadio Business School.

""We're preserving what's most important to us, while recognizing our environment has changed,"" he said.

Here are three pieces of advice on taking over after a leader who looms large — and who might still be down the hall.

Don't be impatient

Stepping into this position successfully starts with indicating sincere interest in the role and prioritizing what's best for the organization, Nancy Ho, an executive coach based in Singapore, told BI.

""You cannot be impatient and rush into it. It should not be seen like you're power-hungry or claiming a role prematurely,"" Ho said.

Instead, she said, new leaders need to focus on understanding a company's culture and how they can position themselves as an asset to the organization.

James Reed, CEO of the UK-based recruitment company Reed, said there is no harm in declaring to your boss that you are ambitious and aim to lead an organization, ""even if you avoid explicitly saying you're after their job.""

""Ask what you need to learn and what more you can contribute to support them,"" Reed said. ""Then they will be aware of your ambition but appreciate that you are seeking to help and learn from them rather than undermine them.""

Don't rock the boat too early

Ho said it's important not to make drastic changes too soon upon getting the job. Ho recommended that the first step is acknowledging the good work done before them. Then, they should gain the team's trust by carefully working with them and making small, gradual changes to improve the organization's effectiveness.

""When there's a certain buy-in, and people are more comfortable with a different leader, then you introduce changes,"" she said.

Sabina Nawaz, a US-based CEO coach, said new leaders should not make changes for at least the first three months because the first thing to do after receiving the title is ""to be curious.""

""Go on a listening tour, excavate the reasons behind decisions or actions, try to make sense of things from the perspective of others: given that they're smart and well-meaning, what did they have in mind when they acted this way,"" Nawaz said.

Christian Tröster, a professor of leadership and organizational behavior at Germany's Kühne Logistics University, told BI that new leaders can demonstrate they're becoming part of the organization by being careful not to suggest that everything should change.

""Because then you're showing that you are not like them, that you cannot be trusted,"" Tröster said. ""Then you don't have the commitment of your employees to actually go with you.""

Tröster said that when an incoming leader would have to report to the person who held the post in the past, it's important to have a conversation about expectations.

He said that while org charts are often clear, layers are often not always evident, including what relationships people have and who they tend to go to for advice.

""I would try to make that visible,"" Tröster said. That way, he said, workers know who they're expected to go to and leaders and employees can agree to the arrangement.

Don't be afraid to be different

For those taking over a new role while their predecessor is still around — especially someone as ""established and admired"" as Anna Wintour, it's important to take advantage of your access to them, Amanda Augustine, a career coach at resume.io, told BI via email.

""Start the job as a sponge, learning what you can from your predecessor and other colleagues,"" she said, adding that it's important not to stay in information-gathering mode forever.

Jochen Menges, a professor of leadership at the University of Zurich and the University of Cambridge, told BI that new leaders should ""be different"" and avoid trying to replicate the exact leadership style or strategy of the person they're replacing.

""If they're too close, then they'll seem to be a copy, and then they can never live up,"" he said. When new bosses are different in some ways, Menges said, they can be ""a leader in their own right."""

Americans buying newly built homes are working with a lot less space, but that doesn't mean their expectations are any lower. In fact, it means they're looking to maximize every square foot.

At the 2025 National Association of Real Estate Editors conference held earlier this month in New Orleans, Rose Quint, assistant vice president for survey research at the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), shared during a panel discussion what today's homebuyers value most.

Drawing from NAHB's 2024 What Home Buyers Really Want report, a national survey of more than 3,000 recent and prospective homebuyers, Quint revealed that buyers are prioritizing spacious kitchens, ample outdoor space, and smart technology.

""High home prices and elevated mortgage rates have made homebuyers keenly aware of what features add the most value to their daily lives,"" Quint said. ""Buyers have determined that investing in the kitchen, in a patio, and home security features enhances the livability of a home.""

According to NAHB's survey, here are four trends shaping homebuying — from a bigger kitchen that focuses on efficiency to smart thermostats that allow homeowners to control their home's temperature remotely."

Every day after work, Alex Meyers picks up her two kids from day care and drives straight to her gym, one of the Bay Club locations in California.

There, she drops them off at her gym's complimentary childcare center for two hours while she works out. When they're done, the family eats the dinner Meyers packed before heading home, doing it all over again the next day.

Like other luxury gym-goers, Meyers pays a few hundred dollars a month (around $500, to be exact) for her membership. She also feels it's completely worth the price tag.

""On the weekends, you could go spend $100 going to the zoo or a museum or some other local kid attraction places,"" Meyers, a 32-year-old civil engineer project manager, told Business Insider. Instead, she takes her children, ages three and four, swimming or to the gym's basketball court. ""We save that money by just going to our gym.""

Luxury gyms have become a third space for many people. Popular athletic club franchises like Equinox and Life Time offer amenities beyond sparkling new equipment and specialty classes, such as childcare services, tidy workspaces, and, in some cases, poolside bars. Younger generations even see gyms as the new social clubs.

It's why people are willing to shell out for shiny memberships, even if they have to budget or sacrifice other luxuries to afford them.

An all-inclusive third space

At the very least, a luxury gym will run you over $200 a month, or at least $2,400 annually. Rob Moal, a personal trainer in Vancouver, spends $260 a month for his Equinox membership.

""With the higher price, I try to use the place as much as I can,"" Moal, 43, said. He goes there six to seven times a week, sometimes even a few times a day, even though he doesn't actually train his clients there.

He likes taking yoga and boxing classes in addition to his solo workouts. If he's not exercising, he's catching up on some work at the gym, unwinding in the sauna, or chatting up other gymgoers.

Given Moal's work experience, he's seen a lot of gyms. He said he likes how clean and organized Equinox is, and who it attracts in turn: often ambitious, full-time workers who he said are also ""very respectful"" of the space.

""It's almost like a social influence,"" he said. ""If I go there in the morning, everyone's very busy and they're doing their thing, and they get out. So it kind of encourages me to keep up the pace.""

For some, it's not necessarily a place to work out

Some members use their gym's other amenities almost more than the gym itself.

Hannah Le, 27, the inventor of the Buckle Scrunchie, spends her days pitching her product to retailers. Instead of trekking back home or hunkering down in cafes between meetings, she finds the closest Life Time. There, she can do some work, charge her phone, or freshen up before a date or party.

""I don't see it as just a gym,"" Le, who signed up at a discount with her roommate and pays $224.16 a month, said. ""They really cover a lot of the other bases for me.""

Le touches upon another factor drawing people to luxury athletic clubs: you don't need to exercise to get a lot out of them.

Meyers takes her kids to the Bay Club even when she feels too exhausted to work out. On those days, she sits in the meditation chair or just reads by the pool.

""It gives me a minute to breathe,"" Meyers, whose husband is on the road on weekdays, said.

No-brainer budgeting

For those working remotely or hybrid, venturing outside the home can cost a pretty penny. Co-working spaces like WeWork and Industrious cost at least $100 a month — cheaper than a gym membership, but without the core perk of having workout equipment and specialty classes.

Fancier options like Soho House have gyms baked in, but run you a few thousand annually.

Coffee shops, meanwhile, add up and aren't always convenient in big cities: in New York, you still have to hunt for a seat and worry about leaving your laptop unattended.

A co-working space at Life Time. Life Time

If it takes a little extra saving to swing a membership, luxury gym members say they are willing to do it. Moal packs his lunches instead of buying Equinox's and budgets for his membership. In months when money is tighter, he'll skip a night out drinking.

Others make up for the gym cost on what they don't spend. Meyers said after-school activities, which sometimes last only 45 minutes for kids as young as hers, can also be expensive and time-consuming to coordinate. Instead, she puts that money toward her gym and its childcare services, which she said include all the toys, crafts, and activities a typical daycare has.

""I can get something out of it, and they get something out of it that they love as well,"" she said.

For some, paying a few hundred extra dollars a month on rent still wouldn't afford them their own place, or even a much bigger room. It can, however, grant them access to multiple spacious facilities almost whenever they want.

Le, who shares the ""tiniest studio apartment with no direct sunlight"" with her roommate, sees Life Time as a slice of luxury she can enjoy every day.

""I use this gym probably more than 95% of the rest of the city does,"" she said. When she first moved to New York and dropped her stuff off at home, it was the first place she went."

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Brita Filter, 39, is a household name in drag entertainment. Her popularity went mainstream when she appeared on season 12 of ""RuPaul's Drag Race,"" and she's made appearances on ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""Broad City,"" and ""The Daily Show with Trevor Noah.""

I first heard of Brita in 2023 when my then-employer, PayPal, was trying to book her for a Pride happy hour near our NYC office. But Google had already booked her for the same coveted time slot: post-work drinks the Thursday before New York City Pride — what Brita says was usually her busiest time of year.

This year, she says her corporate bookings are down by about 60% compared to last year. Another drag entertainer Business Insider spoke to, Holly Box-Springs, said the few June Pride bookings that have come through for her have been last-minute. Corporate interest in Pride is softening elsewhere; around 25% of corporate donors for NYC's Pride parade (taking place Sunday, June 29) have reportedly canceled or scaled back their support, citing economic uncertainty and fear of retribution from the Trump administration.

We asked Brita about how this shift in interest is affecting her career. These are her words, edited for length and clarity.

'I've never had this much downtime in June'

I started doing drag over a decade ago — around the same time as Holly Box-Springs, actually. And I've seen the highs and lows. This year feels especially slow. I've never had this much downtime in June since I started.

All year long, at least twice a month, I fly all over the US to perform — Alabama, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Detroit, Atlanta, Hawaii. Usually I'd fly out on a Thursday, do a show on a Friday or Saturday, and fly back by Sunday for my regular set at a bar in New York City.

But during Pride, drag queens are like Santa Claus during Christmas — everyone wants to book them at the same time.

A typical week leading up to New York City Pride used to be nonstop for me. In 2019, during World Pride, I worked 43 days in a row — no breaks. I was hired by big companies. Some days, I had multiple gigs, back to back. I kept count because it was the year I filmed ""RuPaul's Drag Race."" In one month alone, I made enough money to buy a brand new Toyota Prius.

This year? I only have eight gigs total for the month. It's a complete 180. I used to have a manager, assistant, and publicist, but I've been doing it on my own for the past two years.

I don't have any corporate bookings at all this year. I'm just working a regular bar shift on the 29th — the day of the Pride parade — at Hardware Bar in Hell's Kitchen, where I perform weekly year-round. This week, I hosted a big activation event in Union Square for National HIV Testing Day. The community events — the more politically-focused or pro-LGBTQ charity events — are still happening, but the corporate big-ticket gigs just aren't there.

'We'll do anything for a comma'

When I was booked solid during World Pride in previous years, I'd take as many gigs as humanly possible. If that meant waking up at 6 a.m. and being in drag until 4 a.m. the next day, I did it. We all did. Sleep, skincare, physical exhaustion — it didn't matter as long as the check had a comma in it. We used to say, ""We'll do anything for a comma.""

You just pushed through because that kind of money didn't come year-round. July was for recovery.

This year, I'm not taking July off. I might have to work straight through the month. I'll pick up more shows and cover for people who are out of town. Moneywise, I'll have to figure things out; I'm not sure how.

I'm grateful. Because of my situation [being on TV], my rates are higher. I'm given more opportunities and at times bigger checks. I'm working smarter, not harder. About 50% of my income is from influencer partnerships and content creation for private companies that pay me to spread political messaging.

But I'm spending money as soon as it comes in. For every gig, I have to talk to designers, get a new dress, a new wig, take new photos, do new press. Almost everything I make has to go back into the craft because it's all about the look. My entire job is the look. Or I'm spending money on getting 10 dancers, a rehearsal room, a choreographer, costumes — I'm like my own little Broadway show, except I'm the producer, the artistic director, and the star.

'Corporate interest has changed'

A few years ago, Pride was global. You could feel it. People flew in from all over the world. This year's World Pride in D.C. earlier this month didn't feel global at all. It was mostly Americans. I barely met anyone from outside the country. I think a lot of folks are hesitant to come to the US right now.

Things have shifted. Budgets are different. Corporate interest has changed.

But the work that supports the community directly, such as Pride galas — that's still going. That's what's always mattered most to me anyway."

As soon as your financial life becomes more complex, it's time to seek out these experts. FG Trade/Getty Images

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

I've been working with high-income professionals for over a decade, as a certified public accountant and certified financial planner. During my time working with wealthy clients, one thing has become clear: they don't achieve success alone.

Behind every wealthy client is a trusted team — experts they rely on to make sound decisions and stay ahead. As the saying goes, ""If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.""

In my experience, all of my wealthy clients have five key relationships.

1. Trusted financial advisor

As wealth grows, so does financial complexity. That's why it is crucial to work with an advisor who offers comprehensive services and acts in your best interest—a fiduciary.

One of the most important areas where my wealthy clients seek help is with their finances. By working with a financial advisor, they ensure they have a comprehensive financial plan that supports continued wealth building, protects their assets, and enables them to share their wealth meaningfully.

Delegating this responsibility frees up their time and energy to focus on income-generating activities, like running a business or managing investment properties.

2. Skilled CPA

As soon as your financial life becomes more complex, it's time to bring in a CPA.

Taxes are rarely anyone's favorite subject, and as income and assets grow, so does the complexity. Most of my clients have built wealth through business ownership, real estate, or investments — all of which come with significant tax and accounting challenges.

Every wealthy individual I've worked with has had a strong CPA on their team, not just for tax compliance, but to proactively plan for the future. Don't wait until tax season to realize you need one. Whether it's bookkeeping, payroll, or advanced tax planning, a knowledgeable CPA helps ensure everything is done accurately and strategically.

3. Team of attorneys

Many high-net-worth individuals face legal challenges at some point, whether it's from a disgruntled employee, an unhappy customer, or complex business dealings.

Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

To safeguard their assets, wealthy clients often have a team of attorneys covering areas like business law, estate planning, and family matters. They've worked too hard to build their wealth to risk losing it over avoidable legal issues. Legal protection isn't just about reacting to problems—it's about proactively shielding your assets from potential threats.

Even if you're not yet wealthy, it's wise to begin implementing legal protections early. Asset protection isn't just for the ultra-rich — it's a critical part of building lasting wealth.

4. Life coach

Wealthy individuals often lead complex and demanding lives—running businesses, managing investments, or frequently traveling. With so much happening, it can be difficult to stay centered, grounded, and emotionally balanced.

That's where a life coach becomes invaluable. Life coaches support their clients in improving overall well-being, finding clarity, and aligning their personal and professional goals.

Whether it's navigating life transitions, managing stress, or seeking greater fulfillment, a life coach helps high-achieving individuals live with intention and purpose.

5. Mentor and mentee

Most wealthy individuals have trusted advisors in their corner — people they can count on for strategic advice and direction. Just as important, many of these individuals also give back by mentoring others.

As they climb the ladder of success, they recognize the importance of investing in the next generation, understanding they didn't get to where they are alone. Mentorship becomes a way to carry the torch and uplift others on their journey.

For most of us, the first words we heard come out of Lorde's mouth took the shape of a disavowal: ""I've never seen a diamond in the flesh.""

Lorde wrote ""Royals"" in 30 minutes when she was 15 years old. Growing up in New Zealand, disillusioned with materialism and flex culture — especially in the US — she proudly cast herself as a distant observer. She saw, she understood, but she didn't participate.

This posture resonated with millions. ""Royals"" topped the Billboard Hot 100, where it remained for nine weeks. The smash hit was later certified diamond and won two Grammy Awards, including song of the year.

Lorde has spent much of her career being portrayed as elusive and infallible by fans and media outlets alike. She tends to release an album every four years, and in between, she retreats from the spotlight. Even her stage name (Lorde's real name is Ella Yelich-O'Connor) evokes an office that's separate and superior.

But a lot has changed since ""Royals"" was released as a single in 2013, just a few years after Instagram was launched. At the time, the platform was generally used for sharing one perfectly posed (and heavily filtered) photo at a time. Now, Instagram timelines look much less curated, with the savviest social media enthusiasts sharing unrefined ""photo dumps"" and spontaneous Instagram Stories instead.

Pop culture has tilted dramatically in favor of relatability, transparency, and authenticity, too. Consumers no longer demand polish, poise, or aloof nonchalance from celebrities. ""Mess is in,"" DJ Louie XIV, music critic and host of the Pop Pantheon podcast, recently told me while discussing the state of pop music.

Several of last year's biggest hits corroborate his thesis: Taylor Swift embraced chaos and lust in writing ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" and it became the best-selling album of her career. Chappell Roan canceled concerts, shared off-the-cuff videos on TikTok, scolded photographers on red carpets, and then won best new artist at the Grammys.

Charli XCX's summer-defining album ""Brat"" — which the singer described as ""my flaws, my fuck ups, my ego all rolled into one"" — offers perhaps the clearest example of how this aesthetic has taken over.

""Even Charli's outfits are tattered. She can't sing except in autotune. The whole album is about emotional messiness,"" Louie said. Charli XCX even recruited Lorde for a remix of the track ""Girl, So Confusing,"" to hash out their long-simmering tension in real time.

For the new wave of pop stars, he added, fans ""seeing the seams is a plus.""

Lorde's journey from 'Royals' to 'Virgin' reflects a cultural shift

Lorde has surely noticed this trend because there's plenty of mess in her fourth album, ""Virgin,"" released on Friday.

Gone is the detached, enigmatic attitude from Lorde's debut album, when she insisted, ""I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air, so there."" Now, she won't only throw her hands up, but she'll admit to getting them dirty, just like the rest of us.

Lorde has said that ""Virgin"" represents a sort of rebirth — a newfound willingness to follow her gut and experience the world without a protective veil.

The album's 11 tracks tackle an array of knotty topics, from enjoying unprotected sex (""Clearblue"") and yearning for her mother's approval (""Favourite Daughter"") to dabbling with drugs (""What Was That"") and struggling with an eating disorder (""Broken Glass"").

Lorde's honest lyricism is punctuated with palpable details: a discarded at-home pregnancy test, a dead uncle whom she resembles, blown-up pupils, and rotting teeth. These images make her life feel real and human. ""Mystique is dead,"" she sings bluntly.

This is not to say Lorde has never used personal details in her music. However, her last two albums, ""Melodrama"" and ""Solar Power,"" offered confessions often cloaked in self-conscious theatrics, metaphor, or irony.

When Lorde sang, ""I can't feel a thing / I keep looking at my mood ring / Tell me how I'm feeling"" in the 2021 single ""Mood Ring,"" she was poking fun at the cult of wellness and the blonde caricature she adopted in the music video.

By contrast, when she sings, ""Take an aura picture, read it, and tell me who I am"" in the new album's opening track, ""Hammer,"" it's clear that she's disclosing a raw moment of self-doubt. (And her habit of taking aura photos in New York City's Chinatown is well-documented.)

Lorde's ""Virgin"" co-producer, Jim-E Stack, told GQ how the duo intentionally added sounds that felt raw or jarring to reflect the author's mindset. With AI and modern technology, he pointed out, it's easy for artists to make perfect-sounding records with no hiccups or texture. And when it comes to art, easy usually translates to boring.

left_lean,"Washington As the Trump administration looks to quickly pivot from military strikes to a diplomatic deal on Iran’s nuclear program, the final military and intelligence assessment on the recent US strikes will be critical in informing what the Trump administration needs to accomplish in future Iran negotiations.

Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff will need to use that final battle damage assessment – including a detailed summary of the facilities’ damage and the locale of the nuclear material – to help formulate the US strategy for diplomatic efforts to completely halt the regime’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon in the future, current and former US officials explained.

“You’re not going to the negotiation assuming that the other side is going to tell you everything you need to know about the state of their program,” explained Pranay Vaddi, a former senior official for nonproliferation at the National Security Council.

“We need to have a baseline that is established by the US intelligence community before that,” Vaddi added. “If the Trump administration is committed to some kind of deal still – which it makes statements on – they need to know what they were able to get through military action, compared to what they need to get through the diplomatic process.”

President Donald Trump continues to claim that Iran’s nuclear program has been “fully obliterated,” which does not mirror an early assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency, finding that the attack did not destroy the core components of the country’s nuclear program. The early assessment has split lawmakers on the effectiveness of the strikes. And Trump’s absolutist pronouncements could also complicate Witkoff’s job, officials said.

Even if the facilities themselves have been badly damaged, it does not mean that the nuclear program itself has been wholly destroyed. Prior to the US strikes, experts and former officials had expressed skepticism about the idea that the nuclear program could be militarily destroyed, noting that there would still be people with the knowledge to support it.

“The basic problem is that the equivalency between the success of the bombing and the success of ending the nuclear program is putting pressure on having this narrative that there isn’t a threat,” said Beth Sanner, former deputy director for national intelligence. “If you think that you’ve eliminated the nuclear program then you are not dealing with the fact that there is some residual of that program.”

The critical role of the IAEA

And while the final battle damage assessment will be important to take into account, future negotiations with Iran should prioritize getting the UN’s nuclear watchdog back on the ground in Iran, said former officials who worked on previous Iran negotiations.

“I don’t know that there will be any assessment that I think is fully viable until there are inspectors on the ground,” said a former senior US official who worked on past Iran negotiations. “We must recreate the kind of intrusive verification and monitoring that was in the 2015 deal.”

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had a presence in Iran before the 2015 nuclear deal signed during the Obama administration – a deal which Trump pulled the US out of during his first term – but the presence of IAEA inspectors in the country drastically increased as a result of that deal.

“The deal meant there were inspectors on the ground 24/7, there was electronic monitoring, there was a process by which – that didn’t exist anywhere else in the world – that if there was intelligence about a suspected site, if Iran, over a period of some days, couldn’t satisfy the IAEA that there was a reason the IAEA could go and inspect,” the official explained, citing some benefits of the IAEA inspection efforts.

But this week the Iranian parliament this week suspended its work with the IAEA, because of the “regrettable role” played by the agency’s chief Rafael Grossi, Iran’s foreign minister said. Iran accused Grossi of facilitating the US and Israeli strikes in Iran, citing an IAEA report a day prior to the Israeli strike, which declared Iran was violating its nuclear non-proliferation obligations.

This move follows years of Iran making moves to restrict the agency’s oversight of it’s program. For example, in 2022 Iran responded by removing surveillance cameras from key sites after IAEA censured Iran over uranium particles found at the undeclared sites.

The steps that would need to be taken as part of any verifiable deal on Iran’s nuclear program would likely include: destroying elements of the program that still exist, monitoring any further activity, blending highly enriched uranium, and declaring parts of the program that are in use.

IAEA

In order to prepare to take those steps, inspectors on the ground would be essential, former officials pressed.

“I think it’s been a long time since the US intelligence assessments have been accepted globally as authoritative when it comes to Iran’s nuclear program. They would certainly be challenged by Iran. In order to have a successful negotiation everybody needs to at least agree on the source of facts,” said Laura Holgate, the former US Ambassador to the United Nations International Organizations in Vienna.

“The IAEA will be needed to develop a new baseline of what exactly Iran has, where it is, and what its condition is in, and that’s going to take time, and it will be based on Iran’s cooperation,” Holgate added.

With the IAEA access being diminished over the years and virtually nonexistent at this moment, the world now has large gaps in its knowledge of Iran’s nuclear inventory. That is particularly true when it comes to the locale of Iran’s enriched uranium.

Trump administration officials have said in recent days that the stockpile was not moved ahead of the US strikes but the IAEA said Iran may have moved some of the enriched uranium out of the sites before they were attacked. Vice President JD Vance said the day after the strikes that working on what to do about that fuel would be a priority for the US.

“We’re going to work in the coming weeks to ensure that we do something with that fuel. And that’s one of the things that we’re going to have conversations with the Iranians about,” Vance said.

Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, cited the importance of having “a full accounting” following an all-member classified briefing on Capitol Hill earlier this week.

“There is enriched uranium in the facilities that moves around, but that was not the intent or the mission,” McCaul said. “We need a full accounting. That’s why Iran has to come to the table directly with us, so the IAEA can account for every ounce of enriched uranium that’s there, I don’t think it’s going out of the country, I think it’s at the facilities.”

Complete assessment likely weeks away

The final US military “battle damage assessment could take days or even weeks to complete,” multiple sources familiar with the Pentagon’s process told CNN. CIA Director John Ratcliffe on Wednesday said the agency underscored that a broad intelligence community effort is ongoing to determine the impact of the US strikes on three of the country’s nuclear sites on Saturday.

The Trump administration was already working on possible terms to offer Iran to bring them back to the able for nuclear deal talks before the US military strikes occurred. But if they are able to pull Iran back to the table, they will have to then enter into much more technical talks to put a legitimate and verifiable deal into place.

“I think that you want to strike while the iron is hot, to try and get them to the table while they’re feeling weak,” Sanner said. “One of the key requirements for the negotiation is setting mechanisms for cataloging Iran’s residual capabilities in order to have that conversation and ultimately a deal that is worth the paper it is written on.”"

It's not easy to break into either Hollywood or Wall Street. Aaron Siegel has carved out a place in both.

As head of Goldman Sachs' entertainment investment banking business, he oversees a team of bankers who work on deals spanning a range of sectors, from live events and video games to television and movie production. His team represented amusement park owner Cedar Fair in its $8 billion merger with Six Flags last year, and Niantic, the video game maker behind the hit franchise ""Pokémon Go,"" in its $3.5 billion sale to Saudi Arabia-owned Scopely.

This year, he was named to Billboard's annual list of its Power 100 list — and was ranked No. 8 on the publication's list of finance sector professionals.

As a former Hollywood reporter who now covers Wall Street, I was curious to hear Siegel's thoughts on the future of entertainment and his advice for making it on Wall Street. Siegel joined Goldman as an analyst more than 20 years ago and last year was elevated to partner, the firm's highest rank outside the C-suite.

He said that when the entertainment banking group launched as an independent business line in 2021, he was its sole managing director. Today, he oversees a team of four MDs, including Hemal Thaker, who spearheads the gaming and interactive entertainment business; Gaurav Madan, who handles M&A execution; Jack Kamine, who looks after film, television, and content; and Evin Broder, who's focused on live entertainment, and entertainment services and growth.

Jenny Kim, a managing director at Morgan Stanley, joined in June to lead the bank's music business.

Goldman's expansion comes amid sweeping upheaval in the entertainment industry—from the 2023 dual strikes over AI and labor concerns to climate disasters like California's $250 billion wildfires and mass evacuations.

Here's a look at our conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Take us inside a day in your life, whether your morning routine or how you unwind.

I'm often up early enough to go for a jog through Central Park. It is a global business, and we generally have something fun happening. So as I make my way to the park, I'll check in with our teams in Europe and Asia working on projects. This week, it was teams in Stockholm and Singapore. Stockholm, especially, is a vibrant epicenter for the world of music production.

Once I'm in Central Park, there's nothing better than just having some time surrounded by the earth and the trees. And there's no better way to end a day or a week than with a Little League baseball game, one of my kids' music performances, or getting a chance to attend a religious service performed by my wife, who's a rabbi at a temple here in New York.

What's one lesson or takeaway you try to impart to every analyst or associate who works with you?

When I joined the firm 22 years ago as an analyst, I had the privilege to really be in the trenches with our clients, building those relationships. So I really try to encourage and ensure that our entire team is getting that exposure and building those relationships.

I am inspired by the incredible creativity and tenacity of our clients, and I want our junior bankers to experience working for the most creative entrepreneurs and people in the world.

What are the biggest opportunities and challenges for the entertainment sector today?

Entertainment is a very broad sector, and there are sectors within it, like music and video games, that have grown consistently in recent years.

In Hollywood, film and TV production have gone through a period of just epic challenge from the pandemic to the evolution of the streaming wars — as well as the 2023 actors' and writers' strikes and the LA fires. But I believe from the work we're doing with our clients that the environment for film and TV content has stabilized and is now growing again.

Audiences have re-embraced the theatrical experience at the movies, and the scaled streaming services are on a very strong footing.

It makes sense that companies are uncoupling their businesses so that each have their own capital structures, management teams, and strategic direction. I believe that this will also help people start to operate again from a position of stability and strength.

How is AI — or Hollywood's skepticism of AI — impacting business?

AI is influencing every transaction we work on right now.

We are seeing AI empower creators, writers, songwriters, and directors. It's making content creation easier and more widespread.

Among our client base, AI is proving a win-win for everybody.

I look to music as an example. There're over 100,000 songs uploaded to streaming platforms every day. And share has shifted as a result to independent and DIY artists.

The majors have benefited as well because of their expertise in elevating artists to global superstars. Their knowledge in this environment becomes all the more important since they have the intuition and models to help artists reach the next level.

You have one of the cooler banking jobs I've come across. Tell me about some of the highlights — the nights out and awards shows.

I will never forget being at South by Southwest for the premiere of ""Everything, Everywhere, All at Once"" for one of our studio clients in 2022. I was not even remotely prepared for the grandeur, the emotion, the intensity of that experience in that film. For me, it was an unexpected story about parenthood and having young kids at that moment watching that movie — I did not go into the journey expecting to be so moved.

Looking back on your career, what advice does Goldman partner Aaron Siegel have for the analyst he started as more than 20 years ago?

This is a career that celebrates achievement by changing your role. So as an analyst, you spend two or three years mastering modeling. As an associate, your task is to oversee the narrative of presentation materials. And once you master that, you are then moved into a new role where as a VP managing projects and the day-to-day work with clients.

And these are all wildly different roles requiring you to build different skills. And so my advice would just be to enjoy that experience, embrace the fear of new challenges.

And if you do, you probably won't find a lot of moments of boredom throughout the journey."

If it seems like Formula 1 is inescapable this summer, there's good reason.

Apple's ""F1: The Movie,"" starring Brad Pitt, hit theaters Friday. It's one of Apple's biggest bets on entertainment, with the company's characteristic slick production, A-list cast, aspirational feel, and hefty price tag. The tech giant has gone all out to promote the movie, and even pushed discounted tickets using an iPhone notification.

Apple isn't the only company betting on Formula 1. The sport, with its air of globe-trotting luxury and peak performance, has become a darling among brands. Tommy Hilfiger has a capsule collection tied to the ""F1"" film, and Heineken is using it to work itself into the cultural conversation. Formula 1 kept cropping up in conversations Business Insider reporters had with marketers during the recent Cannes Lions ad festival in the south of France.

How did an exclusive, complex sport, with drivers hidden behind helmets and cars, enter the cultural mainstream?

The sport got a big boost from the Netflix docuseries ""Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"" which was not only a massive hit but was also credited with getting people to watch more races. The series started in 2019 and has run seven seasons so far.

Formula 1 owner Liberty Media has worked to capitalize on the sport's increased popularity in the US. It added a second American race to the calendar in 2022, the Miami Grand Prix, and a third in Las Vegas in 2023, and has amplified the glitz factor with celebrities and splashy ceremonies.

Teams are doing their part. McLaren Racing, home of the McLaren Formula 1 team, is doing a Trafalgar Square takeover in July to promote the team. Louise McEwen, CMO of McLaren Racing, said it was important to reach new and existing fans outside the track.

""Seeing the new fans come into the sport, we needed to show up in their worlds and be meaningful in their worlds,"" she told BI at Cannes Lions. ""Only 1% of fans ever go to the track in their lifetime.""

Formula 1 is still small compared to mainstream American sports like football and basketball, but the US has been one of its fastest-growing markets since Liberty's acquisition, according to Nielsen Sports. Globally, Formula 1 grew its fan base 12% to over 826 million in 2024. Women now make up 41% of the fanbase, and 16- to 24-year-olds are the fastest-growing age group, per Nielsen.

A limitation of Formula 1 is that its drivers are obscured by helmets and cars, making it hard for fans to connect to them. Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali has been on a mission to expand the company's global footprint and US audience by promoting its drivers as actors in the drama of the competition.

Cost is another limiting factor. Even basic tickets to this year's Miami Grand Prix went for hundreds of dollars. Those factors and the complexity of the sport have raised questions about how far its popularity can go.

Brands are eagerly capitalizing on Formula 1's rise

F1 has been considered expensive and logistically challenging from a sponsorship point of view. Still, according to the research firm Ampere Analysis, sponsorship spending on F1 and its teams is expected to reach $2.9 billion this year, up 10% over 2024.

The growth of lower-cost regional marketing opportunities have made it easier for brands to jump in, said Whitney DeMercurio, SVP of sports accounts at Omnicom agency The Marketing Arm. Another factor driving marketing dollars is the 2023 launch of Formula 1 Academy, a development league for women that has its own Netflix series, which appeals to brands wanting to tie themselves to women's sports, she said.

Jae Goodman, whose Superconnector Studios firm connects brands to entertainment, said he saw F1's impact directly at the Miami Grand Prix, where he said that for every official sponsor, there was another brand attaching itself unofficially to the race. He was eager to see how the new Apple movie would confirm its relevance.

""From a marketer's perspective, F1 feels like it's at the center of culture right now,"" he said.

Mastercard, Qualcomm, and Atlassian are among those that are hoping to get the sport's high-tech gloss to rub off on them through team and media partnerships on and off the track.

Some brands are looking beyond just putting logos in stadiums and on jerseys.

For its sponsorship with the Formula 1 Oracle Red Bull Racing team, the Norway-based videoconferencing company Neat had its products used by the team's staff and in their hospitality suite, so that Neat could invite prospects to sporting events.

Uber Advertising, pitching prospective clients, described how beauty brand La Mer sponsored rides to and from the Miami Grand Prix.

Lenovo marketer Emily Ketchen recently discussed with BI how its partnership with Formula 1 includes using AI tech to improve the viewing experience.

""That fusion of tech and performance is where we see a really nice alignment for our brand and for theirs,"" she said."

Hindsight is 20/20 — especially when hindsight is worth $38 billion.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott, his first wife, got married without a prenup (in 1993, before Bezos started Amazon). Scott received roughly $38 billion in Amazon shares in the settlement, making her one of the world's richest women.

On Friday, Bezos got married again, this time to helicopter pilot and former journalist Lauren Sánchez. Experts in family law and wealth management told Business Insider that the couple is almost certain to have a complex prenup. Bezos is, after all, worth more than $200 billion today.

A representative for Bezos didn't respond to a request for comment from BI about whether the couple has a prenup.

Prenups for ultra-high net worth couples involve many parties

Anne Paape, the managing director and head of wealth strategy at Cresset Capital, a multi-family office for entrepreneurs and multi-generational families of wealth, said prenups are generally becoming more common and are sometimes even mandated in family trusts for the ultrawealthy.

Prenups begin with both people fully disclosing their financial assets and debts, she said. Besides family, they can also involve everyone from business partners and tax attorneys to luxury realtors and aviation experts who help appraise homes and private jets, said Brooke Summerhill, a divorce financial consultant who primarily works with ultra-high net worth clients.

""It's not the clients making a lot of these decisions, it's their team helping them understand what those decisions are and making those decisions with them,"" she told BI.

Paape doesn't know the details of Bezos' potential prenup but said his situation isn't entirely unique: Many superrich weddings mark second or third marriages for at least one spouse, often one whose assets have changed considerably since their first time tying the knot.

""He will absolutely have protection against anything that he could,"" Summerhill said, adding that he likely won't let his pre-marriage assets co-mingle with Sánchez's assets.

Business control and property ownership can get complicated

The more money you have, the more potential prenup headaches you'll have, especially when it comes to business interests and properties.

Wealthy clients tend to have properties and business interests around the globe, making it harder to ensure compliance with divorce and death laws in various jurisdictions.

Many entrepreneurs like Bezos are focused on insulating their businesses in the event of a divorce or death. Most don't want to risk giving an ex-partner enough stock to have a say in how the company runs, Paape told BI.

""You could try to compensate for keeping that off the table,"" Paape said. ""What else if you were to get divorced? What other resources could you provide to that person?""

Clauses safeguarding the appreciation of assets during a marriage are also key for wealthy clients, Summerhill said.

What happens if there's a divorce or death?

If the couple ever divorces, it's not unlikely that Sánchez would get a lump sum, Amazon shares, and some real estate, according to Summerhill and Raymond Hekmat, a family law attorney in Beverly Hills who primarily writes prenups.

But a marriage can also end in death, and that's where a death clause can come in. As Summerhill put it, this ""prevents the surviving spouse from claiming a bigger portion of that deceased person's separate property.""

A surviving spouse commonly receives a lump sum or life insurance payout upon their spouse's death, she said, but a last will and testament may take precedent over the prenup.

Dealing with inheritance

Prenups for the ultrawealthy have repercussions beyond the couple, whether it's about who takes over the family empire or gets the keys to the Hamptons home.

""There's more people that care about the resolution of that breakup, whether it's divorce or death,"" Paape said. ""It's business partners, it's employees, it's charities you support, it's children and grandchildren.""

She said trusts ""are a no-brainer "" for children of the ultrarich and that many provisions deal with inherited property or business ownership.

Bezos shares four children with Scott, and Sánchez has three kids.

Prenups are private, but aren't always forever

Hekmat said all the prenups he draws up have a confidentiality provision, and some can include social media restrictions.

""In the event of a breakup, you can't disparage the other party or discuss the prenup in any way with the public, and there could be penalties involved,"" he said.

Prenups can also include sunset clauses, which say that some provisions or even the full agreement expires after a certain period of time. Some people may choose to change certain provisions and become more generous after they've been with their spouse for a while, Paape said.

Hekmat said that even with prenups, couples risk messy legal and financial fights down the line. Proclaimed love and devotion aside, he kept his advice for the Bezoses of the world simple.

""My bottom line for billionaires is don't get married.""

Lauren Sánchez married Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on June 27, 2025, in a dazzling Italian ceremony. Sánchez and Bezos' wedding was a star-studded affair, drawing some 200 guests, including billionaires and celebrities.

Sánchez has captivated the public ever since her relationship with Bezos went public in 2019. Here's a look at Sánchez's life and career.

Sánchez's early career in media

Long before she met Jeff Bezos, Lauren Sánchez was a successful news anchor in Los Angeles. Jean-Paul Aussenard/WireImage via Getty Images

Sánchez had a long career as a reporter and news anchor.

Sánchez grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and studied broadcast journalism at the University of Southern California. She began anchoring UPN News 13 on Los Angeles' KCOP in 1999, where her team won a Los Angeles Area Emmy award in 2001.

Sánchez went on to work as a host at various news channels before landing at Fox 11's ""Good Day LA"" in 2003, where she worked for six years. She then became a weekend anchor and special correspondent on ""Extra"" in 2009.

In addition to once being an anchor in real life, Sánchez has played a news anchor in movies including ""Fight Club,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" and ""The Fantastic Four.""

She also used to host a dancing reality show; Sánchez was a host on the first season of Fox's ""So You Think You Can Dance"" in 2005, but she left the show after one season.

Sánchez's aviation career and company

Sánchez is also a licensed plane and helicopter pilot.

Sánchez learned how to fly while working as a news anchor and she started flying planes in 2011 before getting her helicopter pilot's license in 2016.

Sánchez founded Black Ops Aviation in 2016, a ""female owned and operated"" aerial filming company, which has shot footage for Amazon, Netflix, and Fox, among others.

Sánchez also lent her aerial-filming knowledge to Christopher Nolan as a consultant on ""Dunkirk.""

Sánchez's personal life and relationship with Bezos

Sánchez was married to Hollywood agent Patrick Whitesell for 13 years.

Whitesell is co-CEO of the Hollywood agency WME, and his clients include Matt Damon, Christian Bale, and Hugh Jackman. Whitesell and Sánchez married in 2005 and separated in the fall of 2018.

They finalized their divorce in October 2019 with shared custody of their two children, People magazine reported. Sánchez also has a son from her previous relationship with NFL star Tony Gonzalez.

Sánchez and Bezos got engaged four years after going public with their relationship.

Bezos and Sánchez first connected at a 2016 Amazon Studios party for the film ""Manchester by the Sea,"" according to Brad Stone's book, ""Amazon Unbound."" They would meet again in 2018, when Bezos hired Sánchez's company to film footage for his rocket company, Blue Origin.

Their relationship came to light in a 2019 tabloid scandal, and the couple went public shortly after Bezos and his now-ex-wife, author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, announced their divorce in 2019 following 25 years of marriage.

Sánchez and Bezos got engaged in May 2023. Sanchez was photographed with a large diamond ring on her left ring finger while onboard Bezos' yacht, Koru.

Since then, Sánchez and Bezos have often been spotted cruising on his yacht or attending high-profile events, including President Trump's inauguration.

In 2020, Bezos announced that he would commit $10 billion — about 7.7% of Bezos' net worth at the time — to fighting the climate crisis as part of an initiative called the Bezos Earth Fund. Sánchez serves as the organization's vice chair.

She's also a children's book author — Sánchez's picture book, ""The Fly Who Flew to Space,"" came out in September 2024. She's talked about how her own struggles with dyslexia were part of the inspiration for her writing the book.

In April 2025, Sánchez went to space, leading Blue Origin's all-woman crew. The crew also included ""CBS Mornings"" cohost Gayle King, pop star Katy Perry, Nobel Peace Prize nominee Amanda Nguyen, former NASA scientist Aisha Bowe, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.

The roughly 11-minute journey took the six-person all-women crew past the Kármán line, the internationally recognized boundary of space. Blue Origin says this was the first all-female flight crew since Valentina Tereshkova's flight to space in 1963."
left_lean,"Venice, Italy It’s been both the most public and secretive wedding of the year.

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez concluded their three-day-long Venetian extravaganza on Saturday evening with a celebration at the Arsenale, a former medieval shipyard. The pair was seen traveling via boat to the venue, which hosts the annual Venice Biennale, with reporters and paparazzi in tow.

CNN’s Melissa Bell reported from a boat speeding alongside the couple’s, as they waved on. Sanchez was seen in a pink gown, later revealed by Vogue magazine to be designed by Atelier Versace, while Bezos was in a suit and matching black shirt.

Earlier in the day, the bride and groom were spotted heading into Harry’s Bar, a fabled institution that once counted Ernest Hemingway among its customers. Meanwhile protestors gathered at the city’s train station for a march.



A secretive ceremony

On Friday, the Amazon billionaire and former journalist wed in a private ceremony held on the secluded, historic San Giorgio Maggiore island in the San Marco sestiere. The celebrity guest list included the Kardashian-Jenner family, Bill Gates, Karlie Kloss, Oprah Winfrey and Usher. The approximately 200 guests have seemingly honored a social media blackout once inside each of the weekend’s events.

The ceremony ended discreetly, except for a signal from the fashion world — a Vogue digital cover offering a first look at Sanchez’s gown. After much speculation (and not-so-subtle sightings of designer Domenico Dolce in Venice), it revealed her dress was a custom design by Dolce & Gabbana and was a year and a half in the making. The high-necked lace corseted gown had 180 silk chiffon-covered priest buttons dotting the front.

Over the course of the night, per Vogue, she had two more outfit changes: a sweetheart-neck dress — another reference, this time to the 1946 film “Gilda” — for the wedding dinner, and an intricate cocktail dress featuring 175,000 crystals by Oscar de la Renta.

San Giorgio Maggiore is known for its gleaming marble Renaissance-era basilicas, designed by the Italian architect Andrea Palladio. But there may have been another, more pragmatic reason the couple opted for the island: privacy.

After ongoing protests in the city — including the threat of canal blockades, guerilla-style banners and uncanny Bezos mannequins — allegedly forced Sanchez and Bezos to change one of the weekend’s locations at the last minute, the security and inaccessibility of the island was reportedly a key factor in their decision. Venice’s Ministry of Tourism has estimated the celebrations will generate almost 68% of the city’s annual tourism turnover in just one weekend — but demonstrators have rallied against what they perceive to be a takeover of the idyllic Italian archipelago city by some of the world’s wealthiest people.


During the ceremony, the pair likely exchanged rings symbolically. It remains unclear when the couple legally wed (or if they already have, prior to this week, in the US). A spokesperson for the mayor’s office in Venice had told CNN on Thursday that the city did not receive an official request from the couple, meaning the events this week are ceremonial and will not be legally binding.

Shortly after the Vogue photos were released, Sanchez changed her Instagram account handle to Lauren Sanchez Bezos.

Before Friday’s celebration, Sanchez herself made her way to San Giorgio Maggiore dressed in a ‘60s-inspired tailored white skirt suit from Dior with a printed silk scarf wrapped Hepburn-style around her head, Jimmy Choo heels and an Hermès Kelly handbag. She blew kisses to photographers as she stepped into a water taxi.

Guests have mingled all weekend wearing an array of luxury designers, including vintage Roberto Cavalli, Dolce & Gabbana, Oscar de la Renta and Versace. On the way to the island, Kylie Jenner wore a powder blue long lace-up corset gown, Kim Kardashian chose a slick dark toffee-colored dress and Oprah opted for a draped pink mermaid silhouette.

Though details of the wedding performers, like much else, were largely kept under wraps, Italian media reported that Matteo Bocelli — son of Andrea Bocelli, the revered Italian tenor who performed at both Kim and Kourtney Kardashian’s weddings in 2014 and 2022, respectively — began Friday evening singing “Can’t Help Falling in Love” by Elvis Presley.

The US economy is facing some serious headwinds.

A weaker labor market, a slower baseline rate of economic activity at the start of 2025, and a pull-back from the mighty American consumer could all portend a bigger slowdown later this year.

There hasn't been a recession since the two-month pandemic downturn in 2020. The National Bureau of Economic Research makes the official call, saying its ""definition emphasizes that a recession involves a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.""

Below are three signs that the economy isn't as strong as it once was.

Economic growth last quarter was worse than we thought

The Bureau of Economic Analysis has released three estimates of the rate of economic growth for the first quarter of the year. They do this because, as they get additional information, they can get a better picture of the economy's growth.

Back in April, the BEA's initial estimate of the real gross domestic product's rate of change during the first quarter of the year was negative, the first decline since 2022. Imports, which subtract from growth, rose as businesses responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs.

However, this week's third GDP estimate was worse than expected and the previous two estimates. The third estimate showed real GDP dropped at an annualized rate of 0.5% compared to a 0.2% expected drop and the 0.3% drop reported in the initial advance estimate on April 30.

Consumer spending, which is crucial for GDP growth, cooled in the first quarter. It rose 0.5% compared to 4% in the last quarter of 2024. It was a main reason real GDP was revised down — real consumer spending was estimated at 1.8% in the advance release — and it's pretty ominous since consumers have generally been keeping the economy afloat the last couple of years.

One or two negative quarters of economic growth don't necessarily mean a recession; there are a lot of different measures that go into making that call. Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate, told Business Insider the chance of a US recession is ""modestly elevated, but far from certain.""

May saw a rare drop in consumer spending

The American consumer may finally be reaching their limit.

Real spending has weakened, dropping 0.3% in May from April, according to a BEA report out Friday morning. All told, spending growth has been largely flat since late last year.

While the fall in spending might not seem like a lot, Justin Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan, wrote on X that this is a rare occurrence. He added that it happened during COVID and the financial crisis.

""This may be a bit short of a seismic change, but it completely changes the narrative on the health of the consumer and reconciles the head-scratching disparity between plunging confidence and a swaggering consumer unencumbered by tariffs or a weakening labor market,"" wrote Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Shannon Grein.

Spending was stronger in April and March. Based on other data and BI interviews with consumers, people ended up buying cars, laptops, and other items in response to new tariff policies. That binge may be coming to an end. Spending on motor vehicles and parts in particular fell 6.0% in May, providing a large part of the drop in overall consumer activity.

Economists don't see spending getting better. ""With employment growth slowing, income gains moderating, and the inflationary effects of tariffs building, households are likely to become more cautious with their spending over the summer and into the fall,"" said Lydia Boussour, EY-Parthenon's senior economist.

The job market is getting worse

""The gradual deterioration of US labor markets continues,"" economist Guy Berger wrote in his Substack on Thursday.

Continued claims for unemployment benefits, which measure how many people receiving those benefits have renewed them in the previous week, have been steadily climbing for the last few months, reaching almost 2 million for the week ending June 14 and hitting their highest level since November 2021, when the economy was still recovering from the pandemic shock.

The rise shows people could be having a harder time finding a new job. There were 7.2 million unemployed in the US in May, with 1.5 million unemployed for at least 27 weeks. There was one job opening for every unemployed person in April, down from two job openings for each in 2022 during the Great Resignation.

Still, initial claims, which show people who are newly applying for unemployment benefits and have been holding mostly steady this year, suggest many workers aren't losing their jobs — layoffs and discharges have been low.

""We're seeing this deterioration in continuing claims without a corresponding worsening in initial claims,"" Berger wrote.

Other recent data show job seekers have less bargaining power again. People are less likely to job-hop, partly because openings have cooled. Plus, wage growth isn't as great as a few years ago for job switchers.

It can be hard to even find an opening that matches their interests, especially if they are looking for a white-collar job, or the benefits they want, like a remote job.

Berger expects that the rise in continuing claims could likely lead to an increase in the headline unemployment rate in the coming jobs report. Unemployment held steady at 4.2% from March to May."

She first noticed the plush monsters with toothy grins dangling from kids' belt loops.

Carly Anderson, 45, had discovered the Labubu craze. She was truly initiated into the obsessed fandom when she was gently laughed out of the Pop Mart store at her local mall for trying to buy one of the coveted toys in person.

While she stood morosely by a Pop Mart vending machine, a ""nice gentleman"" gave her tips and a list of third-party stores where she might find a monster, she said.

After 20 hours of legwork and around $180, she tracked down three of the little monsters at third-party sellers and local stores.

What drove the obsession? Love.

""Everybody jokes, 'Oh my gosh, who spends all this time looking for a Labubu?' But for me, this is much more about my daughter — seeing that she's excited about something, and I want to get excited about that thing with her,"" Anderson said. They've bonded and brainstormed over places they can try to acquire a Labubu, and have more time to devote to the hunt now that school is out for the summer.

Anderson has also experienced a strange side effect afflicting other parents: She's grown to find the monsters endearing.

""I have to say, at first I did not understand them at all and I thought they were so ugly, but somehow now I want one too,"" Anderson said. ""I don't know what happened.""

Anderson is part of a new class of Labubu seekers: The parents, grandparents, and guardians conscripted into the hunt and became endeared to the little monsters along the way.

Labubus first skyrocketed to popularity in Asia, where consumers clamored to get the snaggle-toothed monsters and adorn their bags with them. Their popularity has reached all corners of the globe, with Americans, Brits, and South Koreans all fiending to get their hands on the collectible. That's led to a feeding frenzy on the Pop Mart website, app, and reseller groups. To get a Labubu is no easy feat; it requires knowing when they'll drop on the app, on TikTok live, or — in very rare cases — if and when they'll make an appearance in a physical storefront. There's a whole online world of tricks for trying to get a Labubu.

Behind those computer screens, Discord chats, Reddit posts, and Facebook groups are parents and grandparents desperate to get their hands on one of the fuzzy creatures.

Some parents are now in the Labubu game for themselves: Lora Martin, 41, has been trying her best to get an authentic Labubu, but, in the meantime, acquired a knockoff, called a ""Lafufu,"" that she's named Lil Debbie.

""They're strictly for me. These collectibles are for me. I'm not ashamed to say it,"" Martin said. ""It may sound selfish and weird, but I'm 42. I've worked hard and I love these kinds of things. I've been a collector my whole life; this is nothing new.""

She said that her kid, who also enjoys collecting things, isn't interested in Labubus; after all, as she noted, Labubus are explicitly marketed to adults. Her son, 5, is more interested in things like Bluey. Martin now has a Labubu from a reseller on the way.

'It's the crazy things we do for our kids'

On the other end is Mia Ponzo, who used to hate Labubus. Then she found herself waking up at 4:30 a.m. every day for a week to get one.

Ponzo is a grandmother based in Kuwait. She first became aware of the cultlike following that has sprung up around the fuzzy monster dolls through Hermes Facebook groups. She noticed that her fellow Hermes fanatics were posting about dangling the trendy creatures, which come adorned with a key ring, on their bags.

""I initially thought they were the most disgusting things on earth, and I was like, 'who the hell would put this stuff on their bag, why would you ruin a beautiful Hermes bag with a Labubu?'"" Ponzo said of the Hermes-to-Labubu pipeline. But then, ""I don't know, the whole thing started to grow on me.""

Ponzo had been on the Labubu hunt for her granddaughter, who would only settle for a pink one. She woke up early to try to snag one when China-based Pop Mart drops a select few on its website; by chance, she ended up being able to order a full set of Labubus off of Pop Mart's Thailand website, but hasn't had success on the US-based site. In the meantime, she's gotten hooked on the thrill of the chase. She's now deep into everything Pop Mart and has three Labubus of her own, although she's drawn a line in the sand: ""I would never put one on a bag. I don't think so. I don't even wear regular Hermes charms anymore.""

Meanwhile, Kellie Crawford, a 49-year-old mother in Pennsylvania, recently found herself conscripted into what she's deemed the great Labubu hunt. Her daughter went down a rabbit hole after encountering the monsters on TikTok, even going so far as to create an Excel spreadsheet and index cards on how best to acquire one.

While her daughter was trying to game the system, Crawford found herself Labubu backchanneling: She posted on Facebook groups, tried to meet people locally, and did all that she could to secure a Labubu for her daughter's 16th birthday.

""It was crazy. I think several parts of my life are just gone because of the time spent sitting trying to tap on a box and watching a clock tick down,"" Crawford said, referring to the Pop Mart virtual game that is often one of the easier routes to get a Labubu in a cart. She added: ""It's the things we do for our kids. It's the crazy things we do for our kids.""

Finally, she found one on eBay for not too high of a markup, and bought it as a surprise. Before it arrived, her daughter finally purchased the exact same one through Pop Mart. Crawford had to come clean: The same one was already en route.

""I was excited for her, but I felt like I burst her bubble a little bit,"" Crawford said. Then, they suddenly realized what this means: Now Crawford and her daughter could have twin ""Labuskis"" — the nickname her daughter has coined for the toys.

""We have it dressed, and mine — I guess it's now my Labubu — is named Tilly Snack Pac Labuski,"" Crawford said. ""She's the cutest thing, to be quite honest.""

It’s been a tough week for Bryan Kohberger’s defense team.

Defense lawyers for Kohberger, the 30-year-old accused of killing four University of Idaho students in their Moscow, Idaho, home in November 2022, had long suggested the “alternate perpetrator” theory – the idea that someone else killed the students.

But on Thursday, Judge Steven Hippler dealt a crushing blow to the defense, denying their request to identify specific alternate perpetrators before the jury. Idaho law requires the “alternate perpetrator” theory to be approved by a judge before a trial begins.

The defense offered four individuals as alternate perpetrators, according to the judge’s order, of which portions were redacted. The defense’s motion is sealed and not open to the public. The judge ruled the “defendant’s offer of proof can give rise to only wild speculation that it is possible any one of these four individuals could have committed the crimes,” which does not meet the requirements of state law.

“Nothing links these individuals to the homicides or otherwise gives rise to a reasonable inference that they committed the crime,” Hippler said in his ruling. “Indeed, it would take nothing short of rank speculation by the jury to make such a finding.”

The judge also rejected a bid from Kohberger’s defense team to delay the trial, slated to start August 11, saying the defense has not shown “there is good cause” to move back the trial start date. The trial has already gone through numerous delays due to disputes about evidence and witnesses, as well as a change of venue from Latah County to the state capital of Boise.

Lead defense attorney Anne Taylor argued in court last week the “challenges and difficulties” over the last two and a half years have made it so the defense team is still not ready to go to trial.

The blow to Kohberger’s defense comes after Hippler previously ruled he also cannot present an alibi defense – since no one can vouch for where he was during the time of the killings.

His defense team has said he was driving alone in the early morning hours of November 13, “as he often did to hike and run and/or see the moon and stars,” when the students were stabbed.

Kohberger – on whose behalf a not guilty plea was entered – could face the death penalty if convicted of the quadruple murders.

Here’s more of what we know about the “alternate perpetrator” theory – and where Kohberger’s defense team can go now as the options to defend their client continue dwindling.

Defense hoped to pin killings on one of 4 possible alternate perpetrators

The judge’s ruling says the defense suggested four possible alternate perpetrators of the murders, each of whom had some connection to or interaction with the victims in the days before they were fatally stabbed.

Three of the alternate suspects proposed by the defense were “each socially connected to one or more of the victims, interacted with one or more of the victims at social events in the hours prior to the homicide, lived within walking distance of the crime scene and were familiar with the layout of the victims’ home from prior social events,” said Hippler.

But the proposed perpetrators’ opportunity to commit the crime is “an opportunity shared by dozens of others in the victims’ social circles,” said the judge, adding, “there is no compelling evidence that any of them had motive to kill the victims - much less physically harm them - or means to do so.”

A fourth possible alternate perpetrator did not know the victims but had noticed one of them shopping at a store five weeks before the killings, according to the ruling. The moment was captured by surveillance footage.

“He followed her briefly out the exit of the store while considering approaching her to talk,” said Hippler. “He turned away before ever speaking to her.”

The suggested alternate perpetrators have all cooperated with law enforcement, providing DNA samples and fingerprints, the judge’s ruling said. Lab reports have excluded their DNA from samples taken from the crime scene, according to Hippler.

Alternate suspect theory has been front and center for defense

The “alternate perpetrator” has been one of several tracks the defense has highlighted as the trial approaches. During a pivotal pre-trial hearing in April, the defense announced it had received a tip of an alternate suspect, which they were taking very seriously and were investigating.

In May, Hippler said during the final pre-trial hearing he had received the defendant’s proffer or offer on an alternate perpetrator.

At that time, the judge said he would be sealing the paperwork but wanted additional information, asking for actual evidence of an alternate perpetrator rather than just allegations. He also wanted the defense to show how they believed what they were offering was admissible.

Now, in the court’s final order, while the defense may cross-examine law enforcement on investigating and ruling out other leads, they are not permitted to ask about specific individuals as potential alternate perpetrators.

Judge also denied Kohberger’s alibi

In another blow for the defense, Judge Hippler previously ruled that Kohberger cannot have an official alibi defense.

In August 2023, prosecutors told the court that Kohberger’s alibi was only that he was out driving around the night of the killings, and that he had not complied with Idaho’s alibi statute – which specifically requires him to provide names of witnesses to be called to support the alibi, along with their addresses. They said it was now too late to do so.

Since 2023, the defense has continued to push to use an alibi defense, saying the alibi may emerge from cross-examination or expert testimony about Kohberger’s cell phone tower data. The court, however, has continually told the defense they have to comply with the specific requirements of the statue.

During a motion hearing in April, the alibi defense was argued again. Prosecutors renewed their position that the defense can only say Kohberger was out driving around that night and the time his phone was turned off “coincided with the time of the murders.”

They pointed out the only person who can testify to Kohberger’s alibi is the defendant himself. Taylor, Kohberger’s lead attorney, emphasized her client has a right to remain silent.

Hippler then asked Taylor, “if not Kohberger … who is going to say he was driving around looking at the stars?”

The judge ruled the defense expert could show Kohberger was at a certain place until 2:50 a.m. on November 13, 2022, but that no alibi witness would be able to testify, and there would not be an alibi instruction given to the jury.

He also ruled the defense should immediately notify the court if it comes across evidence that supports an alibi. The defense hasn’t filed any motions related to the alibi since that April court decision.

Defense can turn to reasonable doubt

Unable to present an official alibi or suggest specific alternate perpetrators of the killings, the defense will likely focus on raising reasonable doubt that Kohberger committed the crimes.

During the cross-examination of every witness, the defense will likely work to show that Kohberger had no connection to the crime scene and no connection to the victims. They will also try to raise reasonable doubt during cross-examination of prosecution experts testifying about surveillance video allegedly of Kohberger’s car driving to Moscow in the months before the killings and during the early morning hours of the day the students were found dead.

The defense will likely try to discredit any cell phone tower data used to show the location of Kohberger’s phone on the night of the killings, as well as surveillance video from businesses in the area.

The defense has an expert of their own who will argue that Kohberger’s phone data shows he was outside the area at the time of the killings.

Unidentified DNA from blood found on a handrail inside the home could also be helpful to the defense, to further raise doubt that Kohberger was the killer and suggest investigators did not fully do their job.

Cross-examination of the victims’ two surviving roommates will likely be aggressive, especially of Dylan Mortensen. Mortensen told police she saw a masked man with “bushy eyebrows” and wearing all black in their home the night of the killings. Kohberger’s defense have painted Mortensen as an unreliable witness whose recollection of the night has been muddied by intoxication and post-event media exposure.

Both sides agreed they would not focus on investigative genetic genealogy, the technique that led to the identification of Kohberger as a potential suspect.

But in court filings, defense lawyers have floated the idea that the knife sheath found in the Moscow home could have been planted by the real killer. A single source of male DNA on the sheath, found next to the body of Maddie Mogan, was determined to be a “statistical match” to Kohberger.

And although Kohberger has a right to remain silent, he could take the stand himself – testifying in his own defense to explain the many unanswered questions around the case."

Emily Harding had four screens poised and ready to try to get tickets when they were released. ""I almost thought about roping in my housemate too,"" the 34-year-old yoga teacher from London told Business Insider.

This wasn't a Taylor Swift or Burning Man ticket release. It was Hyrox, a fitness race that's taking the world by storm.

""It was like Glastonbury,"" Harding said.

In Hyrox, competitors work in pairs or individually to perform functional exercises, such as wall balls, sled pushes, and rowing. These movements are sandwiched between eight one-kilometer runs. You win by finishing first. Entry costs up to $185 and the winner of the pro division gets a prize of up to $7,500. Unlike CrossFit, which was the dominant fitness contest in the 2010s and features highly technical movements like Olympic lifts, Hyrox was designed to be accessible to anyone who works out regularly.

However, as Hyrox grows more popular — even drawing away pro athletes from other sports, like CrossFit GOAT Tia-Clair Toomey-Orr — it is becoming harder to snag tickets, which are distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.

The first race, in Germany in 2017, featured 650 people. In 2024, over 650,000 participants competed in Hyrox contests globally, making it one of the world's fastest-growing fitness events.

The hype is prompting gyms to launch their own alternative fitness contests, to cater to members who can't get Hyrox tickets — mass fitness events that typically cost a little less to enter, and usually have a cash prize.

Moritz Fürste, one of the cofounders of Hyrox, told BI the organization is aware of the demand and is pushing to keep expanding and optimizing their service. Still, some of the event's biggest fans are say change is overdue.

Tickets like 'gold dust'

Harding described a Hyrox ticket as ""gold dust.""

She first entered three years ago and had no trouble getting in. In fact, when she had to pull out for medical reasons, she couldn't find anyone to take her ticket.

Her second attempt was in June 2025. ""I was really gobsmacked how different it was from now to then,"" Harding said.

Emily Harding, a London-based yoga teacher and Hyrox fan Jerome Favreau

Tickets were released in two waves, at 12 p.m. and then 5 p.m. Harding was applying for women's doubles, so she and her friend each joined the queue on their phones and laptops. Harding was around 6,000th in the queue, and her friend was 10,000th, but then the queue glitched, and they jumped up to around 30,000th. Harding's phone kept pushing her to the back of the queue, she said.

""If you were only doing this on your phone, I can imagine you'd be absolutely fuming,"" Harding said.

Fürste said that server capacities are hard to control, but they are working hard to make the process fair, and it works very well 95% of the time. In 2024, Hyrox UK trialled a New York City Marathon-style ballot system to allocate race places, but the format was scrapped due to overwhelming demand and push-back from affiliates.

Harding and her friend finally got through on a laptop, but the tickets they wanted were sold out. They considered finding two guys to do mixed doubles, but while they thought about it, those tickets sold out too.

They finally got tickets when they tried again in the 5 p.m. release. ""The queueing system was horrible,"" Harding said.

Jamie Thorpe, a sales director from Leicestershire, has competed in two Hyrox games since 2022. He likes the event's accessibility and energy, ""even if many of the competitors seem to forget their shirts.""

The first time he entered, ""we got a place easily — no queues, no ticket drops, no random ballots,"" he told BI.

In the years since, Thorpe, 34, has tried to get tickets more times than he can remember, often recruiting friends to assist, but it's got ""significantly"" harder, he said.

""The organizers can hardly be blamed for the success of their event, and I am fortunate to have attended two already, but that doesn't stop it from being immensely frustrating to miss out so consistently,"" he said.

Danny Rae, the UK men's open Hyrox champion, told BI he's competed in over 25 of the events and advises people struggling to get tickets to join an affiliate gym so they get early access.

""They do still get sold out because it's in such high demand, but you get a better shot,"" he said. ""Another thing to consider is: people will naturally sign up for the Open races. People are scared of the prospect of doing Pro because of the word 'Pro'. If you are active and you train most days, then just go for Pro and you'll be more likely to get a ticket.""

Clifford Saul, a personal trainer of 17 years and the owner of The 200 Strong gym in Leicestershire, UK, thinks the rise of Hyrox is in large part due to the proliferation of fitness culture on social media.

""If social media were as prevalent as it is now, 10 years ago, I think that boom would've happened sooner,"" he said. ""If you put on an event now, it's thrown in your face. All you need to do is look at one reel, and then the algorithms send you loads more.""

Gyms are putting on their own events for people who can't get tickets

Saul is one of many coaches launching other fitness competitions to cater to members who can't get Hyrox tickets.

He is part of a 30-person strong WhatsApp group of local fitness fans who all try to get tickets for each other. Some people never seem to have any luck, others have never had issues, Saul said.

With so many of his members missing out on Hyrox tickets, Saul decided to partner with another local gym to host their own group fitness competition called The District Games.

Clifford Saul, owner of The 200 Strong, a gym in Leicestershire, launched an alternative to Hyrox. The 200 Strong

""The idea is that all the gyms in the area can enter teams,"" he said. ""We want to get all the local community together, put food on, have a DJ, drinks, a bouncy castle for kids,"" he said. ""And we're doing this because we can't get tickets for Hyrox. We can do it a bit differently, and it won't cost £100 each."" Tickets cost £149 for a team of four.

On the other hand, some gym owners are staging large-scale events to rival Hyrox.

There's Athx, a functional fitness contest, launched in 2023, that focuses more on strength than Hyrox. Another is Metrix, launched in March 2025 — an immersive fitness competition that combines high-intensity workouts with club-level production and world-class DJs. Each pair does as much as they can in each of the five 10-minute stations, with four minutes of recovery in between each.

Metrix founder Will McLaren, a personal trainer and former Royal Marine based in London, launched Metrix in March 2025, told BI the atmosphere is dark, so people don't feel like they're being watched, and the exercises are designed to be even more accessible than those in Hyrox.

""50% of people can't do a wall ball because they haven't got the mechanics, the overhead extension of the spine, and the anchor mobility to be able to pull them off, so I didn't want to fall into that trap of being stuck in a set workout,"" McLaren told BI.

Metrix also sells separate ""social"" tickets for those who just want to have fun and don't care about competing — there's a cash prize for whoever wins, though.

""​​It's really important that everyone starts together and everyone finishes together. There's no winners and there's no losers unless you do want to compete for the money.""

The community aspect is important for McLaren too. Metrix has food vans, ice baths, saunas, and kids' games for people to enjoy afterward.

""You're paying £120 for a ticket for Hyrox. It's a lot. People get the patch, they get half a banana, and they get told to go,"" McLaren said. ""So we wanted to make sure people could stay all day, enjoy the music, enjoy the atmosphere, and meet other people.""

Metrix is priced the same, but McLaren said he wants to offer more for that price. He said he is also hoping to partner with a dating app, to build on the trend of run clubs and fitness events as a place to find love.

Saul believes the younger generations' love of fitness means group events won't be going away anytime soon.

""17- to 24-year-olds, they're not going out, drinking, and partying as much anymore,"" he said. ""They're meeting up and doing fitness events.""

In a 2023 survey from McKinsey, more than 50% of Gen Z respondents (generally 13 to 28 years old) said fitness was a very high priority for them, compared to 40% of people across all age groups.

In the UK, 25- to 34-year-olds make up 42% of Hyrox's demographics, and while there are older people doing Hyrox, the brand is mostly driven by millennials and Gen Z.

Fürste, the Hyrox cofounder mentioned earlier, said Hyrox's next goal is ""to deliver the best possible race experience for more than 1 million people in the 2025/26 season.""

They are planning to keep up with demand by launching more races in more countries and cities, with the aim of ""taking the sport to as many people as possible across the world,"" he said.

But for long-term Hyrox fans, the competition's growth, both in the number of applicants and the fitness standard, has seen it evolve from the approachability that was part of its initial appeal.

Thorpe has done the pairs event twice with a very fit friend, and although their times have improved in many areas, their rankings have dropped dramatically.

""The increase in overall standard was extremely noticeable,"" Thorpe said. ""This is, of course, not a problem, but part of what attracted me to the event in the first place was the accessibility, and I hope they don't lose this as the standard continues to rise."""

AP —

Thousands of motorists were stranded for more than eight hours along a section of rural interstate highway in southern West Virginia early Friday after a mudslide caused by heavy rains blocked a storm drain the previous night, flooding the northbound lanes.

Traffic backed up for 12 miles along the West Virginia Turnpike about 20 miles south of Charleston, the state capital. Traffic was not rerouted, and many motorists along the mountainous route had no choice but to remain in their vehicles overnight.

Motorists posted on social media that they had no information on why the standstill occurred, that they had nothing to drink in their vehicles or that their children needed to use the bathroom.

Nicky Walters said in a telephone interview that she felt fortunate while she was stuck because she is healthy, did not not need medicine and had nobody she was responsible for caring for.

“But I felt desperate because I knew that other people needed help,” said Walters, who became stranded while returning to Charleston from a pro wrestling event in Mount Hope. “People needed, at minimum, water bottles passed out and some snacks, much less information. They needed any lifeline to the outside world, and there was none.”

Chuck Smith, executive director of the West Virginia Parkways Authority, said one lane reopened Friday morning but traffic remained at a standstill for hours.

“Traffic should have been detoured to allow drivers an alternate route around the mudslide,” Smith said in a statement. “The Parkways Authority takes full responsibility for the failure to reroute traffic, and would like to assure the public that this will never happen again.”

No injuries were reported.

By the time Brittany Lemon and her family finally got home to Parkersburg, 24 hours had passed since they began returning from their vacation in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

In a video posted to Facebook, Lemon said she had no water and her children needed to use the bathroom. They were able to get an hour’s sleep while stuck on the highway.

“Definitely next year when I go back, I’ll be prepared for an emergency in the vehicle,” she said.

Mitch Carmichael, a former cabinet secretary of the Department of Economic Development, said on Facebook that he was on the turnpike “for hours with no relevant or timely info as to when issue will be cleared.”

He called it “incredibly unprofessional” for the public to be left in the dark and said it gives West Virginia “a terrible image.”

Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that the shutdown “was completely unacceptable. I have directed the Parkways Authority to immediately conduct an investigation and revise its procedures as necessary as a result of this incident.”

Shutdowns of the turnpike have happened before. In 2022 a tractor trailer crashed and spilled a chemical along the turnpike, closing all lanes for most of the day."

President Donald Trump faced another legal loss on Friday after a District Court judge slapped down his executive order against the Big Law firm Susman Godfrey.

In her ruling, Judge Loren AliKhan wrote that the order against Susman Godfrey ""was one in a series attacking firms that had taken positions with which President Trump disagreed.""

""In the ensuing months, every court to have considered a challenge to one of these orders has found grave constitutional violations and permanently enjoined enforcement of the order in full,"" AliKhan wrote. ""Today, this court follows suit, concluding that the order targeting Susman violates the US Constitution and must be permanently enjoined.""

Three other federal judges have already found similar executive orders against Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, and WilmerHale unconstitutional. AliKhan's ruling in the Susman Godfrey case marks a 0-4 record for the Trump administration in legal challenges regarding his executive orders targeting Big Law firms.

Susman Godfrey said in a statement that the court's ruling ""is a resounding victory for the rule of law and the right of every American to be represented by legal counsel without fear of retaliation.""

""We applaud the Court for declaring the administration's order unconstitutional,"" the firm's statement continued. ""Our firm is committed to the rule of law and to protecting the rights of our clients without regard to their political or other beliefs. Susman Godfrey's lawyers and staff live these values every day.""

Harrison Fields, principal White House deputy press secretary, told Business Insider in a statement that the White House opposes Judge AliKhan's ruling.

""The decision to grant any individual access to this nation's secrets is a sensitive judgment call entrusted to the President,"" Fields said. ""Weighing these factors and implementing such decisions are core executive powers, and reviewing the President's clearance decisions falls well outside the judiciary's authority.""

The federal government can appeal AliKhan's ruling, in which case the proceedings will be heard in the court of appeals. Any subsequent appeal would be heard by the Supreme Court.

Fields did not immediately respond to Business Insider when asked if the government would appeal Judge AliKhan's decision.

Judge AliKhan's ruling represents a major legal victory for the firms that have challenged the president's executive orders in court.

While some other Big Law firms chose instead to strike deals with the administration to avoid or reverse punitive executive actions against them — drawing sharp criticism from industry insiders and a spate of resignations among associates and some partners — Business Insider previously reported that Susman Godfrey's decision to fight back in court took just two hours.

In the original April 9 executive order against Susman Godfrey, the Trump administration accused the firm of ""efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections.""

Judge AliKahn had granted the firm a temporary restraining order on April 15, preventing enforcement of the order against Susman Godfrey pending further proceedings.

In issuing her order granting the TRO, the judge said she believed ""the framers of our constitution would see this as a shocking abuse of power,"" according to The American Lawyer.

Susman Godfrey represented Dominion Voting Systems in its suit against  after the 2020 election, which resulted in a $787.5 million settlement, and The New York Times in the publication's copyright suit against OpenAI and Microsoft, which has not yet reached a conclusion."

Elon Musk on Friday announced Tesla had accomplished a major self-driving milestone: The company's first fully autonomous Model Y drove itself to its new home.

""The first fully autonomous delivery of a Tesla Model Y from factory to a customer home across town, including highways, was just completed a day ahead of schedule!!"" Musk said in a post on X.

Tesla's much-anticipated launch of its Full Self-Driving technology has been repeatedly delayed over the years. Musk initially promised Tesla's cars would demonstrate full autonomy by the end of 2017. Despite the persistent delays, the Model Y delivery still marks a major success for the company.

Musk, in his posts on X announcing the feat, added: ""There were no people in the car at all and no remote operators in control at any point. FULLY autonomous! To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully autonomous drive with no people in the car or remotely operating the car on a public highway.""

While the Model Y's highway voyage makes it among the first passenger vehicles to drive itself on an interstate without a human operator, Waymo autonomous cars were granted regulatory approval to start testing their driverless capabilities on freeways in 2024, according to their website — however, while testing is underway, Waymo's robotaxis can't take riders on the highway yet.

Self-driving freight trucks from Aurora have also been operating in Texas since early May, including traversing Interstate 45, where the typical speed limit is between 70 and 75 miles per hour.

Ashok Elluswamy, a Tesla engineer, said in a separate post on X that the Model Y achieved a maximum speed of 72 miles per hour on the highway.

Responding to Elluswamy, Musk said the pace was ""Zippy!""

The exact route that the Model Y took or the speed limits along the way were unclear.

left_lean,"GOP Rep. Don Bacon, who represents one of House Republicans’ toughest battleground districts, has decided not to run for reelection next year, according to three people familiar with his plans – opening up a critical seat in Nebraska for Democrats in the 2026 midterms.

Bacon will formally make the announcement next week, likely on Monday, those people said. Bacon did not return a immediate request for comment from CNN.

The departure of the centrist Republican will be a major loss for House GOP leaders, who will need to hang onto every GOP seat to maintain their narrow majority in the upcoming midterms.

But his decision does not come as a shock to many House Republicans, who believe the retired Air Force officer has been telegraphing his plans to leave Congress, including through his voting record.

Bacon, who was first elected in 2016, has long been weighing whether to seek reelection, making little secret of his frustration with Washington. His victory last fall was seen as one of the biggest Republican surprises in the country, given that he outperformed Donald Trump and overcame stiff Republican headwinds in his Omaha-area district.

The outspoken Nebraskan has been one of the few Republicans willing to challenge Trump on key decisions in his second term, particularly on foreign policy issues like Ukraine. Some privately believe he could seek a run for the presidency in 2028.

House Democrats were already feeling upbeat about their chances of retaking the majority, which would only require flipping a handful of seats next November. The party’s campaign officials point to the long-time historical trends that show new presidential administrations enduring steep losses in their first midterm – as Trump did during his first term in the 2018 wave.

Some Republicans, too, privately fear a blue wave, but they also point to key factors in their favor, including redistricting battles in red states like Ohio that will easily favor the GOP. They also believe Trump’s personal involvement in 2026 – including his fundraising – will be crucial to turning out his voters that largely sat out the 2018 midterm.

left_lean,"The Senate on Friday rejected a Democrat-pushed resolution that aimed to rein in the president’s ability to use military action against Iran without congressional approval.

Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, originally introduced the resolution last week, under the War Powers Act of 1973, before President Donald Trump authorized US strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities. The resolution would have required congressional approval for any further strikes on Iran that are not in self-defense or due to imminent danger.

“I think the events of this week have demonstrated that war is too big to be consigned to the decision of any one person,” Kaine said on the Senate floor on Friday. “War is too big an issue to leave to the moods and the whims and the daily vibes of any one person.”

Lawmakers voted against advancing it to the Senate floor, 53-47.

Sen. Rand Paul speaks on the Senate floor on Friday, June 27. Senate TV

GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted with Democrats to advance the resolution. Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania voted against it.

Friday’s vote was a notable departure from a similar war powers vote in 2020 related to Iran, in which eight Republicans voted with Democrats, seven of whom are still in the Senate.

GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, one of those who had voted for the 2020 resolution and is now up for reelection, wrote on X Thursday, “I’ll be voting with Republicans against the war power resolution. When we’re talking about nuclear weapons, the president should have the discretion he needs to act.”

Indiana Sen. Todd Young, who also joined Democrats to back the resolution five years ago, said in his own post, “Based on President Trump’s stated goal of no further military action against Iran and conversations with senior national security officials regarding the Administration’s future intentions, I do not believe an Iran war powers resolution is necessary at this time.”

Sen. Susan Collins of Maine added, “I continue to believe that Congress has an important responsibility to authorize the sustained use of military force. That is not the situation we are facing now. The President has the authority to defend our nation and our troops around the world against the threat of attack.”

Paul declared he would back the resolution in a speech on the floor, in which he insisted Congress assert its constitutional authority.

“If we are to ask our young men and women to fight, and potentially give their lives, then we in this body can at least muster the courage to debate if American military intervention is warranted,” he said. “Abdicating our constitutional responsibility by allowing the executive branch to unilaterally introduce US troops into wars is an affront to the constitution, and the American people.”

Paul also warned that no one can predict how the Israel-Iran conflict could progress. “History is replete with examples of leaders who in their hubris thought they could shape the fate of nations, but were subsequently proven wrong as events ended up controlling them,” he said.

“Pandora’s box has been opened,” added Paul. “Congress must now focus its effort on de-escalation and preventing the call for regime change – the consequences of which, if applied to Iran, risk the total destabilization of the Middle East.”

The House could bring up its own Democrat-led war powers resolution after July 4. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, who has faced heavy backlash from the administration for criticizing the strikes on Iran, had also introduced a war powers resolution as well, but ultimately decided not to bring it up amid a ceasefire in the Iran-Israel conflict.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has sharply criticized members for demanding Trump receive congressional approval for strikes on Iran, adding that he doesn’t believe the War Powers Act is constitutional.

“Many respected constitutional experts argue that the War Powers Act is itself unconstitutional. I’m persuaded by that argument. They think it’s a violation of the Article Two powers of the commander in chief. I think that’s right,” Johnson told reporters on Tuesday.

He also called allegations that the strikes on Iran were unconstitutional, or even impeachable, “outrageous.”

“It would be comical if it were not so serious and stupid. Let me be clear and be as clear as possible: the strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities were clearly within President Trump’s Article Two powers as commander in chief. It shouldn’t even be in dispute,” he said.

Other Republicans also sharply criticized the resolution, with former Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell warning in a statement that it was “divorced from both strategic and constitutional reality.”

“Was degrading Iran’s nuclear capability without expanding the U.S. military footprint in the Middle East a mistake? Was it wrong to seize the rare opportunity made possible by Israel’s operations over the last 20 months? Did it not demonstrably advance U.S. interests in the region? Or are isolationists correct in suggesting that such interests do not exist?” he asked."
left_lean,"President Donald Trump’s push to pass his massive agenda in the Senate is hanging by thread as GOP leaders barrel toward a critical vote this weekend that, as of midday Saturday, was still short of the support to pass.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune had planned to schedule a critical first vote on Saturday, but a key GOP senator warned he would vote against proceeding to the package unless there are major changes – and several other holdouts are uncertain on how they’ll land.

Thune could not say Saturday afternoon whether he would have enough GOP support for the critical procedural vote. He also did not answer a question about whether he planned to hold that vote.

“We’ll see in a couple of hours,” Thune told CNN.

Pressed by another reporter whether he will have the votes, the South Dakota Republican said, “I hope so.”

The warning shot came from Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who is up for reelection next November and has been one of the most vocal critics of proposed Medicaid cuts used to help pay for Trump’s tax and spending cuts package.

Tillis said Saturday he will vote against the motion to proceed and the final bill assuming it does not change.

Losing Tillis on Saturday’s expected procedural vote – which will be closely watched by Trump – is a major blow to Senate GOP leaders, who can afford to lose only three Republican votes to advance the bill.

Thune and GOP leaders have spent months building to this moment, racing to draft the bill as quickly as possible in an effort to ensure Trump’s agenda is on his desk by the Fourth of July.

Just before midnight on Friday, Senate Republicans released the latest, 940-page version of the president’s domestic policy bill that they want to bring to the floor as early as Saturday afternoon. But more changes could be coming: One Senate GOP aide cautioned this was not the final policy proposal and talks are ongoing with GOP holdouts. The Senate parliamentarian also has yet to rule on certain language, including contentious language on provider taxes, a kind of tax that states can impose to help pay for Medicaid coverage.

If the bill fails its first procedural vote on Saturday, GOP leaders will have to retool the package, amounting to a huge setback for Trump. And it’s not just about that Independence Day timeline: GOP leaders fear that any delay in passing Trump’s agenda would embolden the party’s critics to seek more changes – which could lead their fragile coalition to fall apart.

Already, outspoken fiscal hawk Sen. Rand Paul is planning to vote against it over the plan’s inclusion of a $5 trillion debt-limit increase. And Tillis is not the only Republican who opposes proposed cuts to Medicaid. Sens. Lisa Murkowski, Jerry Moran and Susan Collins have all threatened to vote against the package as they’ve worked with leadership to trim those provisions.

Sen. Josh Hawley — who had raised concerns about the package’s provisions on Medicaid, which he feared would shutter rural hospitals — said Saturday he would back the bill in a major win for party leaders.

Collins, a key centrist vote, said Saturday she would vote in favor of the bill in the initial procedural vote, but was clear her support for the initial vote, did not determine whether she would back the final version.

“That procedural motion does not predict my vote on final passage. I will be filing a number of amendments,” Collins said, who describes the latest text as “an improvement” but said she wanted further changes. If those changes are not made, Collins cautioned she could vote against the bill.

But simply restoring that Medicaid funding may not be enough to win Thune those votes on the floor – it could also cost him votes among Senate GOP hardliners. Sen. Ron Johnson has railed on how the bill is projected to balloon the budget deficit, and another fiscal hawk, Sen. Mike Lee, has suggested he and Johnson along with Sen. Rick Scott could vote as a bloc on Saturday. Johnson indicated Saturday morning in an interview with  that he is not going to vote for the motion to proceed “right now.” Lee and Scott have yet to say how they’ll vote on the key initial procedural vote Saturday.

If all goes to plan, Senate leaders will land the 51 GOP votes to formally begin debating Trump’s agenda and then tee up one of the chamber’s storied traditions: a series of round-the-clock amendment votes known as vote-a-rama. Democrats will use this overnight session to push on any number of GOP weak points on the bill, particularly Medicaid and other safety-net programs.

The Senate could then vote on final passage sometime in the middle of the night Saturday or Sunday morning. And if successful, the House would return midweek to take up the bill with the hope of Trump signing it at the White House on July 4.

One of the biggest hurdles for Republicans is the race to rewrite text in compliance with the Senate’s complex budget rules, which are governed by the nonpartisan parliamentarian.

In recent days, the parliamentarian has ruled against key GOP provisions – from the so-called provider tax, which helps states fund their Medicaid programs, to some provisions of a government spectrum auction. That forces the Senate GOP to dial back those provisions, or else Trump’s bill would be subject to a Democratic filibuster.

The Senate GOP’s newest version includes changes to the provider tax policy, though it’s not yet clear whether it’s palatable to the Republican holdouts. The Senate’s new language also formalizes other compromises in recent days, such as the deal between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and a group of New York Republicans who have demanded bigger tax breaks for state and local taxes, known as SALT. That group won a major increase in the amount of taxes that households can deduct – up to $40,000, from the current $10,000 – but only for five years, rather than the full decade they had sought.

Senate Republicans also further weakened key energy tax credits for wind and solar and phased out a consumer credit to help buy electric vehicles by September.

Ahead of the overnight release of the bill text, several Republicans said Friday evening that they needed to see the final legislation before judging whether they would open debate on the sweeping measure.

“I don’t have the bill, how can I vote on something I don’t know” what’s in it, Johnson said.

Multiple GOP senators dismissed concerns about speeding ahead with the vote without final text in hand.

“We discussed this thing ad nauseam,” Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno said, estimating that Republicans have met on this bill for “thousands” of hours so far this year. “The final tax is not out. But we know where we are going.”

Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri added: “When you have legislation like this, you’re going to have things you need to work through until the very end.”

left_lean,"If President Donald Trump has wielded his executive power like a Mack Truck over the last months, plowing ahead with a velocity unseen in his recent predecessors, his win at the Supreme Court on Friday could act as high-octane fuel in his tank.

By setting new limits on federal judges using nationwide injunctions, the court freed Trump’s hand to pursue his already sweeping view of presidential power in ever more expansive ways. The morning decision punctuated what has been an extraordinary week for the president, both at home and abroad, as he approaches the six-month mark of his second administration.

For a president who continually rails against unelected judges exceeding their mandate by blocking his policies, Friday’s Supreme Court ruling amounted to a form of vindication.

And after a string of presidents chafed against judges who blocked their policies from taking effect, Trump now finds himself freed from some of the burdens his predecessors faced.

“In practice, he has now become a more powerful executive than he was before this decision came down,” said Shira Scheindlin, a former US District Court judge. “But I will say that many presidents have been very unhappy with these national injunctions. It started under George W. Bush, then Obama, then Biden, and of course, Trump,” she said. “It depends whose ox is being gored.”

White House officials were quick to cite a line in Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s majority opinion as bolstering Trump’s criticism of judges he thinks rule beyond their remit.

“When a court concludes the executive branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power too,” wrote Barrett, whom Trump appointed during his first term but had recently been the subject of his frustration — at least before Friday’s ruling.

The ostensible issue at hand in the ruling was birthright citizenship, and there could be immediate repercussions on who is eligible to become a citizen in at least some states. Some Democrats and immigrant rights groups warned of pending bureaucratic chaos, where a baby’s birth state would determine whether they qualified for US citizenship.

But the citizenship issue itself won’t be decided by the court until later. And when Trump emerged in the White House Briefing Room on Friday morning, the matter appeared almost secondary to the larger win that erases one of the checks on his executive authority.

“Thanks to this decision, we can now promptly file to proceed with these numerous policies and those that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis,” an ebullient Trump said from the White House podium.

Aside from the birthright citizenship issue, he listed ending funding for “sanctuary cities,” suspending refugee resettlement, freezing federal funding and blocking taxpayer funds for transgender medical care as examples of areas where the administration now plans to use the ruling to unblock Trump’s orders.

“We have so many of them,” Trump said. “I have a whole list. I’m not going to bore you.”

There are other avenues plaintiffs could pursue to block Trump, including class action lawsuits. And while Friday’s ruling could slow his orders from being blocked, many may still ultimately end up before the Supreme Court.

But at least for Friday, Trump was in a celebratory mood.

The president not only took great delight in the court’s ruling, but in the court itself. He walked into the briefing room wearing a smile of satisfaction, the capstone of one of the most remarkable weeks since returning to power.

His hourlong news conference played out as a victory lap not only for his birthright citizenship executive order but also for his decision to launch military strikes on Iran, despite not knowing the ultimate outcome of either.

The court has yet to rule on the merits of the immigration question and the long-term fate of the Iranian nuclear program is still in question.

“Well,” Trump said Friday as he stepped to the lectern, “this was a big one, wasn’t it?”

He was referring to the Supreme Court opinion handed down less than two hours earlier, but the words also served as a metaphor for the past weeks of his presidency, one that is forever shaped by his first term in office.

Not only does Trump enjoy the luxury of an obedient Republican Party, he also has the enviable benefit of a high court majority shaped by his hand.

Trump is only the latest occupant of the Oval Office to test the powers of the executive branch of government. The court’s ruling on Friday will almost certainly be applauded by future presidents of either party.

“These injunctions have allowed district court judges to be emperors,” Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi, standing alongside the president, said Friday. “They vetoed all of President Trump’s power, and they cannot do that. This has been a bipartisan problem that has lasted five presidential terms. Five different presidents and it has ended today.”

But the fact that he had the good fortune of nominating three Supreme Court justices in his first term and is back to see the fruits of their conservative labors makes him somewhat distinct from nearly all presidents who have come before him.

“I’m grateful to the Supreme Court for stepping in and solving this very, very big and complex problem, and they’ve made it very simple,” Trump said. “I want to thank Justice Barrett, who wrote the opinion brilliantly, as well as Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Thomas. Great people.”

That is not how he was describing Barrett in private over the last several months. Behind the scenes, the president had griped about some of the Supreme Court justices he appointed during his first term, believing they were not sufficiently standing behind his agenda.

In private, some of Trump’s allies have told him that Barrett is “weak” and that her rulings have not been in line with how she presented herself in an interview before Trump nominated her to the bench in 2020, according to sources. Many conservatives were apoplectic in March when Barrett voted to reject Trump’s plan to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid.

“It’s not just one ruling. It’s been a few different events he’s complained about privately,” a senior administration official told CNN in June.

Now, however, Barrett — along with the court’s other five conservatives — handed Trump a win in the most prominent case of the term.

As another Supreme Court term comes to an end, questions will inevitably rise about potential retirements on the bench. The prospect of Trump gaining another appointment is far from certain, but hardly out of the question. White House lawyers have developed an early roster of contenders should a vacancy occur, a standard practice for all administrations.

The president decided to forego a trip Friday to his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, opting to spend a rare weekend at the White House as Senate Republicans work through an impasse over a monumental tax-and-spending bill that contains virtually all of Trump’s domestic agenda. He once again called out those who are raising concerns about the measure, describing them as “grandstanders,” and although he initially suggested his July 4 deadline was not “the end-all,” he later upped the pressure on Truth Social.

“The House of Representatives must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th — We can get it done,” he posted.

As Trump turns toward the second half of his first year in office, myriad challenges await him and his party as the early stages of the midterm election campaign begin taking shape.

Republican pollsters have privately warned party leaders of the potential political fallout from the megabill, particularly the proposed deep cuts to Medicaid and other social safety-net programs to help pay for the extension of Trump’s tax cuts. The president has repeatedly pledged to not touch Medicaid, a promise that may well be litigated in the 2026 campaign.

But Trump offered no signs of anxiety that many of his fellow Republicans in Congress have expressed – particularly about funding for rural hospitals – arguing again Friday that his bill would be beneficial to all Americans.

“It’s a great bill. It’s a popular bill,” Trump said. “But we’ll get no Democrats, only because they don’t want to vote for Trump.”"

She remembers watching the show’s first episode—specifically a scene between Carmen “Carmy” and Natalie, when the chef doesn’t have enough money for his restaurant’s food supply, so his sister brings him his jacket to sell. Before she leaves, she asks him a question. “Have you called mom?” He hasn’t. “You should,” she tells him. At that moment, sitting at home inside what she calls her “witness protection cabin,” Curtis began envisioning what their mother might be like. “Oh, I think I'm going to be her,” she thought.

 

It didn’t take long. In “Fishes,” the sixth episode of the second season, she debuted as Donna Berzatto, embodying Carmy and Natalie’s mother whose alcoholism and mania has turned her home—and large family gatherings—into a mental trauma zone. Though very different from her character, Curtis could relate to Donna’s substance abuse issues and mothering challenges, and leaned into her most toxic traits. By the end of the electric and overwhelming episode, for which Curtis won an Emmy, Donna has drunkenly left the Christmas dinner table and crashed a car into her house, effectively fracturing her relationship with her son. But in Season 4, Donna gets a chance to make amends. About five years after the disastrous holiday, she spends the majority of the ninth episode, “Tonnato,” sharing her regrets with Carmy inside her home. While looking at old family photos together, Donna admits she’s been sober a year and then reads an apology letter, acknowledging the pain she’s caused and explaining the reasons for her poor choices. Carmy eventually reciprocates, sharing his guilt for leaving the family and expressing his love for her. It’s a powerful, emotional exchange that crystallizes the season’s redemptive, healing themes. Then, as an act of reconciliation, Carmy prepares for his mother a chicken dinner that he learned to make while training as a chef at The French Laundry.



Here, Curtis unpacks that emotionally charged sequence as she talks about the experience of playing Donna, and how her own life informed parts of the character. I’ll be honest, I get anxiety every time your character appears on the show—and I think it's mostly because we've only really seen you through Carmy's perspective. What was genius from the beginning was you don't meet Donna for 16 episodes. The anxiety is built up through hearing about her from other people and the amount of anxiety Carmen carries. She's designed to create instability. What I found beautiful is that in episode 10 of Season 2, when they're opening the restaurant and Donna's out front chain smoking—I said to [creator Chris Storer], “I think [Donna] is sober four months. She has enough self knowledge now to know that she has an effect on people, particularly when she's drinking. And so the pacing in front of the restaurant is the “Do I? Don't I?” push and pull of addiction, which, when you're newly sober, you're very fragile.



You show up in a couple episodes this season, specifically for Episode 9’s conversation with Carmen. How does it feel for you to parachute in and out of Donna's headspace every year? We shot Season 3 and 4 simultaneously. So the truth is, I did the scene with Sugar in the hospital, which was an entire episode. And two days later, I did my part at the wedding. And then the next day, my scene with Jeremy at the house. So it was a lot of Donna, which was not dissimilar to the Christmas episode where I came in for like a three-day bombardment and then was gone. I've been an actress since I was 19. I've done a lot of different work. Some of it good, some of it great, some of it awful—much of it awful. Everybody works differently. I also didn't know how Chris worked before we met on the Christmas episode. Our entire relationship was a text relationship where he said, “So excited you're coming!” And I said, “How do you want her hair to look?” And he sent me a picture of Monica Vitti. And then I said, “What about her nails?” And he sent me a picture of the desperate housewives of New York and that was the entirety of the background that I got from him before I walked in the kitchen the day we shot “Fishes.” I got a sense that he understood that I was going to show up fully-loaded ready to shoot. That gave me a lot of confidence and a lot of freedom because I knew, having seen the level of intensity, what the show was like.

What was your initial impression when you read this scene between Donna and Carmy, and how did you want to approach it? People forget that she hasn't seen Carmen since Christmas five years earlier. It's not like there's a chyron that's under the screen that reminds the audience at the wedding. And obviously she has seen the rest of the family. She attended the birth of her granddaughter. She goes to family birthdays. She sees Lee. She sees Jimmy. So there's an indication that she is a part of this interesting melting pot family, but she hasn't seen Carmen. So that moment when she sees him at the wedding—and the way all his friends come around him and are like, “Hey, they need you in the kitchen right now.” Donna knows what's going on. She's very smart so she understands that this is a big moment for both of them. And then she has that lovely scene with Sydney and then she gets the f-ck out, because she understands. In recovery, there's a phrase, “We suit up and show up.” So Donna is suiting up and showing up. And of course who does she run into? Michelle.



And Michelle says, “Are you good?” And we all know that question is Donna's fire starter. Right. That is the fire starter, one of those clicking flame things that we all have in our houses to light matches. It's that click. And her response, which is, “I'm good.” And then get the f-ck out. I'm not going to play Michelle. I'm going to go. And so we've teed it up beautifully. Yep. I'm sober. I've been sober a long time. I talk to a lot of sober people. Part of being sober is acknowledging the past. There is a process within being a sober alcoholic or sober drug addict that in order to move freely into the future, you have to acknowledge the past. I don't think Donna wanted to acknowledge it with him for a long time. I think she's been working on that for the better part of a year. She’s had that little piece of paper in her desk drawer, and when he comes over, I think the intention was to see him and keep it light and polite—another phrase we use in recovery. And I think that was her plan until she started going through the pictures and saw Mikey.



Yeah, I wondering if you wrote that letter yourself. It was from the script, but of course I did! Was that a cathartic experience—thinking about what that symbolizes generally for a mother to a son, but then also specifically for Donna to Carmy? Very much cathartic. We both knew what we're doing. The script is beautiful. I learned that having a kid who you don't know how to help is one of the most powerless experiences as a parent. I personally have a child with special needs. I have a child who has a learning difference. And the powerlessness you feel when you can't actually help them—you can find people who can help them, but you can't. So the part of that scene that gets me every time is when she talks about Mike. Because clearly Mike had that problem since he was a little boy. And being a parent and not being able to help your kid and not knowing what to do to help them—and finding that alcohol just made it all more palatable and easy—to play a woman who has struggled with that, and then to have the beautiful writing that articulates that exact powerlessness and turmoil, and resulting shame and self-hatred, and then the addiction on top of it—I just thought it was a beautifully constructed.



The line that hits me the hardest throughout your interplay is when you tell Carmy, “I don't know you, and you don't know me, and I did that.” Was there a line or a moment in this conversation that impacted you the most? Oh yeah—what I just said about Mike. I did that as a statement of fact. I have to live with that. She also says it to Sugar in the hospital when Sugar says, “You scared me and I don't want my baby to feel scared.” I said, “I scared you?” Hearing that you have that effect on a human being's life is powerful. And so I can totally accept that we're operating as strangers in this family. That is when she really is showing the pain and suffering of her own childhood, her marriage, her being a mother to three. That is when Carmen really softens and says, “I'm sorry, I wasn't there for you.” What does Leonard Cohen say? ""There has to be cracks because that's where the light comes in."" That's the moment when you understand that Carmen is now understanding the multitude of Donna and what she has struggled with.



What was it like working with Jeremy that day? I feel very motherly toward all three of these kids. I've stayed a little in contact with them in the most cursory way. I'm not pretending we're buddies, but I also reach out occasionally. So he and I have that. Again, not with any supposition that it's more than it is. He's just a beautiful performer. We use the term scene partner a lot in actor talk, but he's a scene partner. We don't rehearse it. We don't talk about it. We stay away from each other until it begins, and then it begins. And he has beautiful eyes, and they are expressive and soulful and sorrowful and very alive at times and very emotional at times. And I think you see all of that in this whole season, but in that scene in particular. And then the coup de grace, which is him cooking for her. I really love that he goes back to his time at French Laundry where he learned to make roast chicken. Do you feel like a meal is one of the kindest gifts you can give somebody?



For sure. I'm not a foodie. I was raised by a very skinny woman. Food was not a friend in a generation of women in her industry who starved themselves under the tutelage of the studio system. My mother was incredibly beautiful and she held it all the way through her life. While many of her other friends succumbed to middle age, she starved it away. So I was raised around cereal and a grilled cheese sandwich, which would be like gold for me. But apparently I make really good penne with butter, garlic salt and a little parmesan cheese and my elder daughter, Annie, was talking with her friends about memories in their high school years of having me make that penne. Hearing that that is a memory for my daughter is something comforting. I'm kind of embarrassed by it because it's not a French Laundry chicken. And yet the act of making it and the act of receiving it as something special is very moving to me. Of course Carmy is going to truss and baste and bake and broil a beautiful chicken for his mother. It's a wordless moment and, needless to say, very moving. It's very clear that there's a path forward through that act that is him basically saying, “I'm sorry that I didn't kind of meet you, that I stayed away from you and that I didn't face this.” It’s pretty powerful to end a series on a full-circle moment.



He also tells you not to wash chicken in the sink. Yeah, because, of course! What he's saying is that the salmonella goes all over the place. You think it's just going down the drain, but in fact, you're polluting your sink.

This season felt very redemptive and healing in a lot of ways. What it was like to have a moment of reconciliation with Donna, as opposed to playing such a vicious antagonist? I'm the child of alcoholics. I'm a sober drug addict and alcoholic. I have lost so many friends to alcoholism and drug addiction. My baby brother died at 21 of an accidental heroin overdose. We're also living in a world that doesn't feel redemptive. When you talk about an antagonist, it feels like there are antagonists running the world right now. So from a spiritual place, if we're not healing, we're dying. And I didn't know if Donna was going to heal or get a chance to. I saw it in Season 3, but as I said to you, I already knew that Season 4 was coming. I don't know the origin stories necessarily, but if we're not healing, what are we doing? And so I'm beyond grateful that Chris gave everybody a moment of grace—every single person's story!



The end of Season 3, Carmen says that in his vision for the restaurant, “to make it good, you have to filter out the bad.” And I think this whole season was in line with that mission statement. It's just gorgeous work. The grace note at the end—you know those sandwich shops are going to be successful. We know what the numbers are going to be. They're going to blow the place up. But Carmen also knows he has to step away from this and let these people do it. And the fact that that's the gift that he's giving everybody, and that he'll now go figure out who Carmen is. And he'll be able to do it with a mother in his life now. Yeah, and Donna is sober now. Can Donna stay sober? I hope so. I've stayed sober. What was wack to me—the same day that this season of the show dropped, I woke up in the morning and a friend of mine in Los Angeles sent me a picture of a billboard on Sunset Boulevard. It's the Foundation for a Better Life, a program they run called “Pass It On.” Inspirational people and ideas. And there's a billboard with my picture that says, “My Bravest Thing? Getting Sober. Recovery. Pass it On.” And for Jamie and Donna, who had different stories but the same disease, to have that happen simultaneously was kind of another grace note.

We finally know what Lauren Sánchez wore on her wedding day.

On Friday, the 55-year-old author, mother, and former journalist walked down the aisle toward Jeff Bezos, 61, while wearing a long-sleeved Dolce & Gabbana gown, as seen in photos taken by Tierney Gearon for Vogue.

The dress had a bustier bodice with white buttons down its front, a mermaid skirt with a long train, a high neckline, and a lace overlay that was ""hand-appliquéd,"" according to the outlet.

She also wore the Alta Gioielleria Miracolo earrings from Dolce & Gabbana for the nuptials.

Sánchez told Vogue that Bezos was eager to see the dress before the wedding, but she wanted to surprise him.

""As you get a little older, not many things surprise you. I can't wait to see his face,"" she told the outlet.

A moment of Italian drama

The feminine gown and her floor-length veil perfectly complemented the romantic aesthetic of Bezos and Sánchez's Venice ceremony.

Sánchez told Vogue that she began thinking about her dress design over a year ago, and researched 1950s brides at the time. A picture of Sophia Loren wearing a lace, high-neck outfit became her ultimate inspiration.

""It is a departure from what people expect,"" she told the publication, ""from what I expect — but it's very much me.""

Then she went to space, which further inspired the mom of three.

""It went from 'I want a simple, sexy modern dress' to 'I want something that evokes a moment,' and where I am right now,"" she told Vogue. ""I am a different person than I was five years ago.""

Her groom, whom she said would be ""pleasantly surprised"" by her gown choice, wore a classic black Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo.

The billionaire Amazon founder paired his jacket and trousers with a black bow tie, a white button-down shirt, and a black vest. While taking a water taxi to the ceremony, he also sported $630 sunglasses from Louis Vuitton.

Sánchez bucked tradition with much of her wedding style. She arrived in Venice in a black dress on Wednesday, wore a corseted Schiarapelli gown to an event on Thursday, and then left for her wedding in a retro-looking set that she paired with a headscarf.

She also began sporting a new ring while in Venice: a massive oval diamond that experts at Rare Carat told Business Insider could be worth more than $6 million.

The wedding was a long time coming. The couple's relationship became public in January 2019, shortly after Bezos and MacKenzie Scott announced their divorce.

left_lean,"For months, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett has faced fierce criticism from conservatives over some of her decisions in cases involving President Donald Trump.

That even included Trump at times.

But after Friday’s blockbuster opinion in the birthright citizenship case, that blowback was suddenly a distant memory.

It was Barrett, who Trump nominated to the high court in September 2020, who delivered the president a clear and dramatic win, kneecapping the ability of lower court judges to block his agenda. Trump, who has privately complained about Barrett, was effusive in his praise.

“I want to thank Justice Barrett, who wrote the opinion brilliantly, as well as Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Thomas – great people,” Trump said during a celebratory news conference at the White House.

“I just have great respect for her. I always have,” Trump said. “And her decision was brilliantly written today — from all accounts.”

Given the Supreme Court’s 6-3 conservative supermajority – cemented when Barrett succeeded the late liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg – the court’s liberal wing has always faced an uphill climb to wind up anywhere but in dissent. But at times, Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts have shown willingness to break from their more conservative colleagues.

Many conservatives were apoplectic in March when Barrett voted to reject Trump’s plan to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid. The backlash over that decision from some close to Trump was swift, with one conservative legal commentator describing her on a podcast as a “rattled law professor with her head up her a**.” Others took to social media to describe her as a “DEI hire” and “evil.”

The anger directed at Barrett, a former appeals court judge and law professor, intensified when the Supreme Court divided 4-4 in a high-profile case questioning whether a Catholic charter school in Oklahoma should be entitled to taxpayer funding. Barrett recused herself from taking part in the case – she had multiple ties to the attorneys representing the school – and the even split left in place a ruling from Oklahoma’s top court that found the school unconstitutional.

In private, some of Trump’s allies had told him that Barrett is “weak” and that her rulings have not been in line with how she presented herself in an interview before Trump nominated her to the bench, sources told CNN.

“It’s not just one ruling. It’s been a few different events he’s complained about privately,” a senior administration official said earlier this month.

So it was notable that Barrett, the second-most junior member of the court, was assigned Friday’s major opinion. Because the senior-most justice on each side of a decision assigns the author of that decision, it means Roberts assigned the case to Barrett. Most court watchers assumed Roberts would write the opinion himself, or that it would be unsigned.

It was, by far, the highest-profile opinion Barrett has authored on the court.

And it was a major win for the president – the second time the Supreme Court has ended a term in as many years with a blockbuster ruling in his favor. Last year, the court ruled that Trump was entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution on federal election interference charges.

Barrett’s opinion doesn’t necessarily mean that Trump will be able to enforce the birthright citizenship order. Lower courts are likely to move swiftly to shut it down through other paths, such as through class-action lawsuits. But it will at least make it harder for groups challenging future Trump policies to get those measures paused on a temporary basis.

“As the number of universal injunctions has increased, so too has the importance of the issue,” Barrett wrote, without addressing the fact that some of that increase has been the result of a president who had admittedly sought to push the boundaries of the law in his favor.

“As with most questions of law, the policy pros and cons are beside the point,” Barrett wrote. “Under our well-established precedent, the equitable relief available in the federal courts is that ‘traditionally accorded by courts of equity’ at the time of our founding. Nothing like a universal injunction was available at the founding, or for that matter, for more than a century thereafter.”"
left_lean,"Warning: This post contains spoilers for M3GAN 2.0. M3GAN became a surprise hit in early 2023, earning nearly $182 million worldwide against a budget of just $12 million, due in part to the balance the movie managed to strike between creepy horror and campy comedy. Here was an AI-powered doll who came pre-loaded with meme-worthy dance moves and the ability to spontaneously burst into an a cappella rendition of Sia's ""Titanium,"" but who was also capable of chasing school children into oncoming traffic and fatally wielding a machete. Over two years later, M3GAN 2.0 brings its sassy titular android back for a sequel that delivers on the comedy front, but strips M3GAN of her horror appeal in favor of a more action-centric plot.

 

When a horror sequel featuring the same big bad as the first movie gets the green light, there's generally one of two routes it can go: a new and improved (or, more often, not so impressive) take on the original story or a Terminator 2-style installment in which the villain comes up against an even greater threat. M3GAN 2.0, written and directed by Gerard Johnstone, opts for the latter, a decision that sends the franchise in a new direction by giving M3GAN (played by Amie Donald and voiced by Jenna Davis) a redemption arc following her previous murderous rampage. ""For me, it was just so obvious, because the reaction to the first film happened on this global scale,"" Johnstone told Variety of the reason for the tonal shift. ""The technology that M3GAN has is being fought over by various nations. At the moment, everyone’s in this race to be the first to get AGI. It felt like a story that needed to play out on a much bigger canvas.""



(L-R) M3GAN battles AMELIA in M3GAN 2.0. Universal Pictures

In the two years that have passed since the events of the first film, roboticist Gemma (Allison Williams) has become a staunch advocate for government regulation of AI, while her now-preteen niece Cady (Violet McGraw) has thrown herself into computer science and the martial arts practice of aikido to work through her trauma. But when a team of FBI agents breaks into their home one night, Gemma learns that not only did M3GAN's digital consciousness survive the destruction of her body, but her underlying tech was also stolen to create a military-grade AI super-soldier named AMELIA (Ivanna Sakhno). Oh, and AMELIA has gone rogue and wants to destroy humanity.



Naturally, this development forces Gemma to team up with M3GAN and build her a new and improved body in order to try to save the world alongside her colleagues Cole (Brian Jordan Alvarez) and Tess (Jen Van Epps), and fellow tech activist Christian (Aristotle Athari)—a potential love interest who, surprise, actually turns out to be the person behind AMELIA's creation. While we won't get into the somewhat convoluted details of how exactly AMELIA intends to bring her goals to fruition, just know the movie reads as a satirical cautionary tale about the evolution of AI. Johnstone, however, has said he views the sequel as more of a parenting allegory. ""We’re not saying, 'Don’t build AI.' We’re asking, 'What happens when you don’t train it right?'"" he told Creative Screenwriting. ""You don’t train kids like dogs. You raise them. That’s the same with AI."" In the end, an action-packed showdown at a Palo Alto tech campus culminates in M3gan proving she has developed true empathy by sacrificing herself in order to save Cady and Gemma, and eliminate the threat of AMELIA and the mysterious all-powerful Motherboard AI she's after. But worry not, M3GAN 2.0's final moments reveal M3GAN's source code is still alive and well, leaving the door open for future sequels that could fall under a variety of genres.



According to Johnstone, the sky is apparently the limit. ""I would not be surprised if there’s another five of these movies,"" he told the Hollywood Reporter. ""So, who knows, maybe I’ll come back for the fifth one."""
left_lean,"Washington The US military did not use bunker-buster bombs on one of Iran’s largest nuclear sites last weekend because the site is so deep that the bombs likely would not have been effective, the US’ top general told senators during a briefing on Thursday.

The comment by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, which was described by three people who heard his remarks and a fourth who was briefed on them, is the first known explanation given for why the US military did not use the Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb against the Isfahan site in central Iran. US officials believe Isfahan’s underground structures house nearly 60% of Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile, which Iran would need in order to ever produce a nuclear weapon.

US B2 bombers dropped over a dozen bunker-buster bombs on Iran’s Fordow and Natanz nuclear sites. But Isfahan was only struck by Tomahawk missiles launched from a US submarine.

The classified briefing to lawmakers was conducted by Caine, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. A spokesperson for Caine declined to comment, noting that he cannot comment on the chairman’s classified briefing to Congress.

During the briefing, Ratcliffe told lawmakers that the US intelligence community assesses that the majority of Iran’s enriched nuclear material is buried at Isfahan and Fordow, according to a US official.

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy told CNN on Thursday night after receiving the briefing that some of Iran’s capabilities “are so far underground that we can never reach them. So they have the ability to move a lot of what has been saved into areas where there’s no American bombing capacity that can reach it.”

An early assessment produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency in the day after the US strikes said the attack did not destroy the core components of the country’s nuclear program, including its enriched uranium, and likely only set the program back by months, CNN has reported. It also said Iran may have moved some of the enriched uranium out of the sites before they were attacked.

The Trump officials who briefed lawmakers this week sidestepped questions about the whereabouts of Iran’s stockpile of already-enriched uranium. President Donald Trump again claimed Friday that nothing was moved from the three Iranian sites before the US military operation.

But Republican lawmakers emerged from the classified briefings on Thursday acknowledging that the US military strikes may not have eliminated all of Iran’s nuclear materials. But they argued that doing so was not part of the military’s mission.

“There is enriched uranium in the facilities that moves around, but that was not the intent or the mission,” Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas told CNN. “My understanding is most of it’s still there. So we need a full accounting. That’s why Iran has to come to the table directly with us, so the (International Atomic Energy Agency) can account for every ounce of enriched uranium that’s there. I don’t think it’s going out of the country, I think it’s at the facilities.”

“The purpose of the mission was to eliminate certain particular aspects of their nuclear program. Those were eliminated. To get rid of the nuclear material was not part of the mission,” GOP Rep. Greg Murphy told CNN.

“Here’s where we’re at: the program was obliterated at those three sites. But they still have ambitions,” said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. “I don’t know where the 900 pounds of highly enriched uranium exists. But it wasn’t part of the targets there.”

“(The sites) were obliterated. Nobody can use them anytime soon,” Graham also said.

Weapons expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies Jeffrey Lewis told CNN that commercial satellite images show that Iran has accessed the tunnels at Isfahan.

“There were a moderate number of vehicles present at Isfahan on June 26 and at least one of the tunnel entrances was cleared of obstructions by mid-morning June 27,” Lewis said. “If Iran’s stockpile of (highly enriched uranium) was still in the tunnel when Iran sealed the entrances, it may be elsewhere now.”

Additional satellite imagery captured on June 27 by Planet Labs show the entrance to the tunnels were open at the time, according to Lewis.

The preliminary DIA assessment noted that the nuclear sites’ above ground structures were moderately to severely damaged, CNN has reported. That damage could make it a lot harder for Iran to access any enriched uranium that does remain underground, sources said, something that Graham alluded to on Thursday.

“These strikes did a lot of damage to those three facilities,” Murphy, the Connecticut Democrat, told CNN on Thursday night. “But Iran still has the know-how to put back together a nuclear program. And if they still have that enriched material, and if they still have centrifuges, and if they still have the capability to very quickly move those centrifuges into what we call a cascade, we have not set back that program by years. We have set it back by months.”

Caine and Hegseth on Thursday said the military operation against Fordow went exactly as planned but did not mention the impacts to Isfahan and Natanz.

I review lots of TVs every year, and as performance improves across the board, it's becoming harder for flagship models to stand out. But LG's G5 doesn't have this problem. Simply put, the G5 OLED offers the best picture quality I've ever seen from a consumer TV. Panasonic's upcoming Z95B has a chance to surpass it, but for now, the G5 is the premium 4K TV to beat.

Using LG's latest OLED panel technology, the G5 balances perfect contrast with high brightness, sharp detail, rich colors, and wide viewing angles. This is the kind of high-end image quality that makes home theater nerds like me geek out. The G5 also has solid smarts via LG's webOS interface and some cool new perks like AI voice recognition.

However, the G5 isn't quite perfect. Though the set's image performance is nearly flawless, it does have some minor issues with color gradients and over-brightening. These imperfections are subtle, though, and the displays' many strengths outweigh them. I also wish LG's webOS placed less emphasis on shopping recommendations, but I'm more than willing to ignore an ad here and there if it means getting such a fantastic viewing experience.

It's also important to note that this is an expensive display. Most people will be satisfied with a cheaper midrange OLED, like LG's C5 and C4, or Samsung's S90D. But premium sets like the G5 aren't geared toward most people. This is a pricey TV built for enthusiasts willing to spend top dollar on top picture quality and design. And in that sense, it's the best TV of its kind.

The TV has an elegant design, but a stand costs extra

LG's G5 is available in 55, 65, 77, 83, and 97 inches, with list prices ranging from $2,500 to a whopping $25,000. For this review, I tested a 65-inch unit, which retails for $3,400. With the exception of the 97-inch model, all sizes offer the same specifications. The 97-inch model uses a different kind of OLED panel, so it can't get as bright as its smaller counterparts.

The G5 uses LG's One Wall design, which allows it to be mounted with virtually no gap. A bracket is included in the box to accomplish this, so you don't need to buy one separately. On the downside, LG doesn't include a traditional pedestal stand, so if you don't want to mount the G5, you need to purchase a stand on your own. LG sells a stand for $106 (which was used for this review), and the G5 is compatible with many of the best TV stands made by third-party manufacturers.

Though the G5 looks best when mounted, it still has an elegant style when placed on its pedestal. The display is made of premium materials and has a thin profile that measures just under an inch thick. The build and aesthetics are what you'd expect from such a pricey display and are a clear step up from the cheaper construction of more budget-friendly models.

LG also gets points for including four HDMI 2.1 ports to enable support for up to a 4K/165Hz signal. Many rival brands, including Sony, only include two HDMI 2.1 ports and use HDMI 2.0 for the remaining inputs. This is a great perk for gamers who want to connect multiple systems to the TV, as HDMI 2.1 is needed to unlock the smoothest performance on current-gen consoles and high-end PCs.

LG redesigned its Magic Remote for 2025, and this new version is mostly an improvement. It has a thinner, more traditional shape instead of the bulky body used on past LG remotes, which makes it feel better in hand. Its main selection button, which doubles as a scroll wheel, also feels sturdier, making clicks more responsive. Sadly, the remote is not backlit, which has become standard on some competing TVs from TCL, Hisense, and Roku.

Like past models, the Magic Remote lets you choose between navigating via standard button presses or by using motion controls (the ""magic"" part) to point the remote at the screen to move a virtual cursor. Unfortunately, there's no way to fully deactivate motion control if you don't like it. Clicking on the directional pad temporarily turns it off, but it gets turned back on if you slide the scroll wheel, and this is too easy to accidentally trigger.

The remote's button layout has also been simplified, and I generally like this more minimalist approach. But there are two odd choices. First, there's no longer an input select button. To switch inputs on the TV, you have to hold down the Home button to pull up a smart hub menu or scroll through the homepage and find the input you like on screen. Second, there's no mute button. You can still activate mute by holding the remote's volume down button, but this means there's no way to rapidly lower the volume instead of fully muting it. These are small complaints, but they just strike me as strange choices.

The G5 delivers a new benchmark for premium image quality

The G5 is the brightest OLED TV on the market. Steven Cohen/Business Insider

The G5 is the first consumer TV to use LG's new four-stack OLED panel design. This type of screen has key benefits over the standard WOLED panel used on LG's cheaper C and B series TVs. A four-stack design optimizes how an OLED produces color and light, allowing for higher brightness and a wider color gamut — all while maintaining the pixel-level contrast, deep black levels, and wide viewing angles that the best OLED TVs are known for. You can learn more in our QLED vs. OLED comparison.

The results are spectacular, and the TV offers a big leap in brightness over last year's G4 model. In fact, the G5 is now the brightest OLED TV available, dethroning the Samsung S95F. Using the TV's Filmmaker mode with a 10% HDR test pattern (a white box that takes up 10% of the screen against a black background), I measured a peak brightness of 2,410 nits.

That's nearly 1,000 nits more than last year's G4, which is a substantial bump. It's also about 240 nits more than the S95F, which is a more subtle but still noteworthy jump. While such high brightness is impressive, it's important to remember that it's only beneficial in certain circumstances. For example, high brightness gives you more headroom to pump up luminance to help overcome glare in rooms with a lot of ambient light.

It also allows the G5 to produce more impactful and accurate high dynamic range (HDR) images with highlights (like explosions) that pop from the screen. But the G5's full brightness capabilities only get unleashed when watching movies and TV shows mastered for above 1,000 nits. You can learn more about HDR mastering and how it relates to content and TVs in our HDR guide.

Raw brightness is only a part of what makes the G5's image quality so noteworthy. What makes this TV shine is how it's able to precisely harness its brightness and combine it with pixel-level contrast control, inky black levels, and rich colors. I watched a wide range of movies and TV shows across several weeks with the G5, and I've never seen a consumer TV that matches its picture capabilities.

Some of its benefits over other high-end sets are subtle, and it has some flaws that a few rivals handle better, but overall, the G5 rises above the competition. Fiery explosions in high-brightness HDR movies like ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" radiate from the screen with rich saturation, while deep shadows in the opening sequence of ""The Matrix"" remain perfectly dark without any halos around lighter elements of the picture.

Tricky sequences in movies like ""1917"" and shows like ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"" that trip up the local dimming backlights on many QLED TVs I've tested are displayed with perfect, uniform contrast. And image quality barely shifts if you're off to the side of the screen, so everyone gets a good viewing experience no matter where they sit.

LG's picture processing continues to improve year after year, and the G5 is able to hold its own against high-end Sony TVs. Lower-quality content like compressed HD YouTube streams and cable TV upscale nicely on the G5. To be clear, they still don't look as good as native 4K sources, but the TV does a good job of minimizing imperfections without introducing an unnatural look.

But as phenomenal as the G5 is, the TV's image quality isn't flawless. When it first hit stores, the G5 had issues with color banding, also called posterization or false contouring. This caused some gradations of colors and dark shades to look blocky rather than smooth.

This problem initially appeared in some Dolby Vision and HDR10 content, but during my testing, LG released a firmware update that corrected Dolby Vision playback. However, some banding still popped up in isolated scenes when watching a small selection of HDR10 videos. But throughout my weeks with the TV, this flaw was very subtle and only appeared in a couple of movies I sampled out of more than a dozen.

After my evaluation period ended, LG released another firmware update in June. This latest version reportedly corrects those lingering problems with HDR10 so long as you use the TV's Filmmaker preset. With all that in mind, I don't consider this to be a major drawback.

Another small imperfection I encountered involved some slight over-brightening in near-black content, which caused dark shades to faintly glow. I noticed this a bit when watching some dim sequences in the Amazon Prime series ""The Wheel of Time,"" but it was never too distracting. This issue is common on OLED displays like this, and the G5 performs about on par with what's expected.

Finally, it's also worth noting that while the G5 rises above competing flagship OLEDs in nearly every way, there is one area where top models from Samsung and Sony still have a slight edge: color volume. High-end OLEDs from those brands use quantum dots, which is a feature the G5 is missing. This allows those TVs to maintain high saturation a bit better when displaying especially bright colors. The G5 improves upon the G4 in this area, but it still can't quite match OLEDs that have quantum dots.

Gamers get cool features like a 165Hz refresh rate and support for Xbox streaming

The G5 is one of the most advanced gaming TVs there is. It supports ALLM (auto low latency mode), VRR (variable refresh rate), and a dedicated Game Optimizer menu that lets you easily adjust settings. The G5 sets itself apart from most competing TVs with its support for up to a 165Hz refresh rate. Most high-end TVs max out at 144Hz. This is only useful for PC gamers with high-end hardware, but it's still a cool perk.

LG is also one of two brands (Samsung is the other) that supports the Xbox app directly through the TV's interface. If you have a Game Pass membership, this app lets you stream Xbox games so you can play them without needing a console. The quality isn't as good as playing a game directly through a system, and playability is heavily reliant on the stability of your internet connection, but it works well enough for casual gaming.

I also tested the G5 with a PS5 using a 4K/120Hz connection, and it delivered excellent image quality and smooth motion. I didn't see any flicker or ghosting with VRR active, which is something I've seen on some QLED TVs. Some flicker did show up when I pulled up the TV's settings menu while playing games, but this went away as soon as I closed the window.

However, I've seen some user reports of banding in certain games when using the TV's HDR Game mode, even after the latest firmware update released in June. But outside some subtle bands in the sky when playing ""Cyberpunk 2077"" and some slight contouring in menus, I didn't encounter any egregious banding when playing various HDR titles, including ""The Last of Us Part 1,"" ""Spider-Man,"" ""No Man's Sky,"" ""Dragon's Dogma 2,"" and ""Baldur's Gate 3.""

LG's webOS adds some new AI features, but they're mostly unnecessary

LG's webOS interface is decent, but we prefer platforms like Google TV and Roku. Steven Cohen/Business Insider

Like all LG TVs, the G5 uses the webOS smart TV system. The platform is easy to set up, as LG guides you through some basic housekeeping items.

The interface has access to all of the best streaming services, though it's missing a few niche apps that some other platforms support, like the Criterion Channel. General navigation is smooth, and I didn't encounter any major lag when moving through services. That said, the interface's design could annoy some users. By default, webOS displays a banner ad at the top of the homepage, and the screen prominently features a row for shopping recommendations.

You can deactivate the banner ad if you navigate through some buried menu options, but this leaves that space unutilized. You can also turn off the shopping recommendations, but this deactivates all of the platform's content suggestions, leading to a barebones interface. It's great that LG offers the option to fully deactivate the ads, but I wish there was a better balance to begin with, so it could display content recommendations while demphasizing some of the sponsored material.

For 2025, LG is touting a lot of new AI features, but most of these functions are just improved iterations of features that have already been available on past-generation TVs. For instance, there are AI picture modes that are meant to enhance the image, especially with lower-quality content, but the adjustments these modes make are unnecessary.

The company has also brought back its AI Picture Wizard and added a new AI Audio Wizard. These features present you with various sample images and audio clips. Based on which ones you select, the wizard learns what kind of picture and sound settings you like the most, and then creates custom modes for you. Again, I highly recommend just using the TV's Filmmaker mode and Standard audio mode to get the most accurate playback, but if you're unhappy with how the G5 looks or sounds, this is worth playing around with.

LG's AI concierge offers content recommendations, but they didn't seem to relate much to my viewing habits. Steven Cohen/Business Insider

LG's remote also emphasizes AI more this year, as the microphone button has been rebranded as the AI button. Pressing it pulls up LG's AI concierge. This is supposed to present smart content recommendations based on your viewing habits, but I didn't find them to be all that useful. Holding down the AI button allows you to search with your voice or speak commands to control the TV. The G5 also supports hands-free voice search.

I'm not sure what the issue was, but during my first week or so with the TV, I ran into a lot of server errors and ""voice not recognized"" messages when using the G5's voice search. Over time, these glitches stopped popping up, and voice search worked consistently. That said, I found the TV's voice recognition to be less accurate and slower than some competing systems, like Roku and Google TV.

On the plus side, the G5 does have a new voice feature that's actually pretty cool. It's called AI voice recognition, and it automatically switches user profiles based on who speaks to the TV. So, if your spouse was using the set and you both have different profiles, once you speak to the TV, it will switch to your personalized home screen with your preferences and recommendations.

Should you buy the LG G5 TV?

The G5 is the ideal TV for home theater fans focused on picture quality. Steven Cohen/Business Insider

Few TVs have left me as utterly impressed as the LG G5. Some competing high-end sets from Sony and Samsung offer better performance in certain aspects, but when looking at picture quality as a whole, the G5 is the best premium display I've seen. Panasonic is set to release a similar TV later this year, called the Z95B, so I'm curious to see how it stacks up. But for now, the G5 is the reigning king of premium TVs.

Though picture performance isn't flawless, the TV's combination of pixel-level contrast and high brightness is unmatched and outweighs any shortcomings. LG's webOS interface isn't my favorite, and I did run into some software issues that ironed out over time, but it gets the job done. The new AI voice recognition feature is also a cool addition.

The G5 is expensive, so it's only suited for big picture quality enthusiasts and those willing to spend extra for high-end design flourishes that you can't get on cheaper TVs. But if you fit that bill, the LG G5 TV earns my highest recommendation."

One of the richest men in the world is officially off the market.

On Friday, Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez got married in a lavish ceremony in Venice, as the bride confirmed in an Instagram post.

They were surrounded by around 200 guests, including wealthy and powerful people like Kim Kardashian, Bill Gates, and Ivanka Trump.

Bezos, 61, and Sánchez, 55, wed nearly two years after their engagement was first announced, and speculation about where and when they would marry reached a frenzy in the months before the event.

In March, the mayor of Venice, Luigi Brugnaro, confirmed in a statement that the couple would get married in the city. Bezos and Sánchez were also spotted in Italy multiple times in the lead-up to their big day.

Demonstrators took to the streets ahead of the wedding, expressing concern about the nuptials contributing to overtourism in Venice and that the wedding wouldn't benefit locals.

A representative for Bezos and Sánchez didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

The couple ultimately got married on the Venetian island of San Giorgio Maggiore, taking separate water taxis to the ceremony.

Sánchez wore a cream Dior set as she made her way to the venue earlier in the evening. After the ceremony, she revealed her wedding dress in an Instagram post, changing her name to ""Lauren Sánchez Bezos"" and wiping her profile of everything but a wedding photo.

Sánchez's lace wedding gown, designed by Dolce & Gabbana, had a high neckline, buttons running down the center, and a mermaid skirt. A floor-length veil completed her ensemble.

Bezos wore a traditional Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo to the wedding.

Bezos and Sánchez's relationship became public in January 2019, shortly after Bezos and his ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, announced they were getting a divorce. Sánchez was married to Patrick Whitesell at the time, though they filed for divorce in April 2019.

Bezos and Sánchez made their first appearance as a couple in July 2019, and in the years since, they've become fixtures of celebrity and business circles as a unit. Reports that they were engaged were first published in May 2023."

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

New satellite images show construction equipment at Fordow, one of Iran's bombed-out nuclear sites. Efforts appear to be underway to repair damage and dig out new access paths.

In the images, which were captured on Friday by the US commercial satellite imaging company Maxar Technologies and obtained by Business Insider, new activity was documented near the tunnel entrances, as well as the points where heavy US bombs struck Fordow over the weekend.

One image captured excavators and bulldozers apparently moving dirt near craters and holes on the northern mountain ridge at Fordow.

The main strike points for the bombs, the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bunker-busters, per the Pentagon, were exhaust shafts that allowed the weapons to penetrate deep into the underground complex.

Other images capture what looks like construction equipment digging new access roads to the facility, as well as engaging in efforts to repair damage on the main access road. Iran may be attempting to restore access to the underground site in order to assess the condition of it and its equipment, though that's not explicitly clear.

A closer view of Fordow raises questions on whether Iran is attempting to restore access to Fordow's underground facilities. Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies

A Royal United Services Institute report from March of this year noted that if there wasn't a long-term strike campaign that prevented Iran from doing so, ""efforts to dig down to the facilities to re-establish access and supplies would likely begin almost immediately"" after a strike on its nuclear program.

With the recent ceasefire, US and Israeli efforts to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities have ended. President Donald Trump has said the strikes ""completely obliterated"" the facilities, and Israel has determined that the strikes set Iran's program back years.

Fordow was one of three nuclear sites targeted by the US in the strikes last weekend aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear program. The US also struck Natanz and Isfahan, the first with air-dropped bombs like Fordow and the second with sea-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles.

The full damage to these sites and how degrading the strikes were to Iran's overall program, stockpiles of enriched uranium, and equipment are unclear. The extent of the damage to the program is still being assessed.

RUSI experts previously speculated that a crippling strike on the Fordow fuel enrichment plant ""would likely require multiple impacts at the same aiming point to have a good chance of penetrating the facility.""

At a Pentagon press briefing Thursday, Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shared that during the ""Operation Midnight Hammer"" strikes, MOP bunker-buster bombs were dropped one after another down exhaust shafts.

The general also shared that Defense Threat Reduction Agency personnel spent roughly 15 years studying Fordow and working on how best to destroy Iran's nuclear program.

US President Donald Trump has said Iran will never be able to rebuild the facilities. That is unclear. Other US and Israeli officials, as well as nuclear arms experts, have said the strikes set Iran's ambitions back by a few months to years, but this is not the same as determining whether Iran can still build nuclear weapons.

It's difficult to bomb a country's knowledge out of existence, and there have been assessments that Iran may now be more eager to develop a nuclear weapon than before.

The US strikes came after Israel launched a new campaign earlier this month intended to degrade Iran's nuclear program, which Tehran argues is for civilian use. The US had been seeking to reach a nuclear deal with Iran through negotiation; however, it opted for an alternative approach this past weekend, hitting Iran instead and then calling for peace.

In retaliation for the US strikes, Iran fired ballistic missiles at a large US air base in Qatar this week. The US said none of Iran's missiles hit the base. US leadership has said it had advanced notice about the strikes. A ceasefire has since gone into effect, stopping the exchanges of fire for the time being."
left_lean,"The Supreme Court delivered a major win to President Donald Trump on Friday in his ongoing war with the federal judiciary, limiting the power of courts to step in and block policies on a nationwide basis in the short term while judges review their legality.

Though the case was intertwined with Trump’s executive order effectively ending birthright citizenship, the ruling does not settle the issue of whether the president can enforce that order. And there were signs that lower courts could move swiftly to block the policy.

But the high court’s decision does mean that Americans seeking to challenge Trump’s future policies may have to jump through additional hoops to succeed. Exactly how that will work remains to be seen and will be hashed out by lower courts in coming days.

Here’s what to know about the court’s decision:

Important win for Trump

The Supreme Court’s 6-3 ruling could have far-reaching consequences for Trump’s second term, even if his birthright citizenship order is never enforced. That’s because it will limit the power of courts to strike down other policies in the future.

Presidents of both parties have complained about nationwide injunctions for years and Trump has noted, correctly, that there have been far more issued against him than presidents in the past. Lower courts, for instance, have used the orders to temporarily block his efforts to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act and prohibit transgender service members in the military.

“This was a big decision,” Trump said from the White House shortly after the ruling was issued. The president described the outcome as an “amazing decision, one that we’re very happy about.”

But exactly how future litigation shakes out remains to be seen. Private parties – in the birthright citizenship case, a group of pregnant women who sued – may still be able to get a court to shut down a policy temporarily through a class-action lawsuit.

And states may still be able to secure a hold on an administration’s policies in the short term as well.

SCOTUS time is Trump’s time

By siding with Trump, the conservative Supreme Court ended a term with a second blockbuster decision in his favor for the second time in as many years.

Last year, a 6-3 majority ruled that Trump – and other presidents – are at least presumptively immune from criminal prosecution for actions taken in office. The decision allowed Trump to avoid a trial on federal election subversion charges that were pending against him.

And since taking office again in January, Trump has won case after case on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket. A decision earlier in the week allowing Trump to deport certain migrants to countries other than their homeland marked the 10th time the court has granted a request from Trump on the emergency docket, though a few of those cases amounted to a mixed win for the administration.

The court has allowed Trump to fire board members at independent agencies, remove transgender Americans from military service and end other protections for migrants, even those in the country legally.

Friday’s ruling, from Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who Trump has disparaged behind closed doors, is his biggest win yet.

Jackson: ‘Executive lawlessness will flourish’

The court’s three liberals split from their conservative colleagues’ blockbuster ruling in blistering dissents, ringing the alarm on how the decision will permit Trump or future presidents to enforce unlawful policies even as legal challenges to them play out.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the liberal wing, said the majority had “shamefully” played along with the administration’s “gamesmanship” in the case, which she described as an attempt to enforce a “patently unconstitutional” policy by not asking the justices to bless the policy, but instead to limit the power of federal judges around the country.

“The court’s decision is nothing less than an open invitation for the Government to bypass the Constitution. The executive branch can now enforce policies that flout settled law and violate countless individuals’ constitutional rights, and the federal courts will be hamstrung to stop its actions fully,” she wrote.

Video Ad Feedback US Supreme Court limits use of Nationwide injunctions 09:12 - Source: CNN US Supreme Court limits use of Nationwide injunctions 09:12

The court’s senior liberal member took the rare step of reading parts of her dissent from the bench on Friday for around 20 minutes. In doing so, she added in a line not included in her written dissent to invoke the court’s landmark ruling last year that granted Trump broad immunity from criminal prosecution.

“The other shoe has dropped on executive immunity,” Sotomayor declared from the bench.

Separately, in a scathing solo dissent on Friday, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson appeared to raise the stakes of the injunction case even more, accusing her conservative colleagues of creating “an existential threat to the rule of law” by allowing Trump to “violate the Constitution.”

“I have no doubt that, if judges must allow the executive to act unlawfully in some circumstances, as the court concludes today, executive lawlessness will flourish, and from there, it is not difficult to predict how this all ends,” she wrote. “Eventually, executive power will become completely uncontainable, and our beloved constitutional republic will be no more.”

Shift to class-action lawsuits

Though the court significantly curtailed the ability of Trump’s legal foes to get the type of court orders that block or slow down his enforcement of various policies nationwide, the conservative justices left on the table one key legal avenue: class-action lawsuits in which a litigant sues on behalf of a larger group of similarly situated individuals to get relief for all people who could be potentially be affected by a policy.

Several groups moved quickly Friday to do just that.

The immigrant rights groups and pregnant women challenging Trump’s order in Maryland pressed the federal judge who previously blocked the policy to do so again through a class action lawsuit.

Such class-action litigation could potentially lead to the same outcome as nationwide injunctions – and during arguments in the case, several justices questioned the significance of shifting the emphasis to class-action suits. One difference is that a judge generally must take the extra step of thinking about who should be covered by an injunction.

During arguments in the case in May, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the difference may be nothing more than “technicality.”

“We care about technicalities,” he said at the time. “And this may all be a technicality.”

Lawyers for the Maryland plaintiffs asked US District Judge Deborah Boardman to certify a nationwide class that would include any children who have been born or would be born after February 19, 2025, and would be affected by Trump’s order. They filed an updated lawsuit that would challenge Trump’s order on behalf of all of those potential class members.

They also asked Boardman, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, for an emergency order that would temporarily block Trump’s executive order from applying to members of a “putative class” of individuals that would be impacted by the policy.

“Consistent with the Supreme Court’s most recent instructions, the Court can protect all members of the putative class from irreparable harm that the unlawful Executive Order threatens to inflict,” the lawsuit states

The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing challengers in another case over Trump’s order, on Friday filed a new class action lawsuit targeting Trump’s order.

“That’s one of the ways in which people who are harmed around the country by President Trump’s effort to end birthright citizenship will be able to go and get protection from the courts for this fundamental American right,” ACLU national legal director Cecillia Wang told CNN.

States will keep fighting

Barrett was careful to say that parties could still seek nationwide relief to pause a policy if that was required to address their harm. That is precisely the argument nearly two dozen Democratic states made challenging the birthright policy and while the court didn’t directly address it, it left wide room for states to make that claim again.

The states had argued they needed a nationwide block on Trump’s birthright citizenship policy because it was too easy for people to cross state borders to have a baby in New Jersey – where that child would be a citizen – rather than staying in Pennsylvania, where it might not.

Now, the states will likely return to a lower court and argue that the birthright policy should remain on hold while courts decide its constitutionality.

“We believe that we will prevail and that we’ve made the case already, and when the lower courts, under the instruction of the US Supreme Court, do that review, we will secure a nationwide injunction to provide relief to the plaintiff states,” California Attorney General of California Rob Bonta, a Democrat, told reporters.

“It’s now up to the lower courts to reconsider if the nationwide injunction is appropriate and necessary to provide complete relief to the states whose AG’s sued to challenge this order,” he said.

That litigation could eventually work its way back to the Supreme Court.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said the administration was “very confident” the Supreme Court would eventually rule in its favor on the merits of Trump’s executive order.

“Birthright citizenship will be decided in October, in the next session by the Supreme Court,” Bondi predicted at the White House.

While Bondi’s predicted timing might be optimistic, given the court’s usual pace, there is a good chance the issue will eventually wind up before the justices."

Denver AP —

A Colorado funeral home owner who stashed nearly 190 dead bodies in a decrepit building and sent grieving families fake ashes was sentenced to 20 years in prison in federal court Friday for cheating customers and defrauding the federal government out of nearly $900,000 in Covid-19 aid.

Jon Hallford, owner of Return to Nature Funeral Home, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud last year and had faced a maximum of 20 years in prison. Federal prosecutors sought a 15-year sentence and Hallford’s attorney asked for 10 years.

In court before the sentencing, Hallford told the judge that he opened Return to Nature to make a positive impact in people’s lives, “then everything got completely out of control, especially me.”

“I am so deeply sorry for my actions,” he said. “I still hate myself for what I’ve done.”

Hallford will be sentenced in August in a separate state case in which he pleaded guilty to 191 counts of corpse abuse.

Hallford and co-owner Carie Hallford were accused of storing the bodies between 2019 and 2023 and sending families fake ashes. Investigators described finding the bodies in 2023 stacked atop each other throughout a squat, bug-infested building in Penrose, a small town about a two-hour drive south of Denver.

The morbid discovery revealed to many families that their loved ones weren’t cremated and that the ashes they had spread or cherished were fake. In two cases, the wrong body was buried, according to court documents.

Many families said it undid their grieving processes. Some relatives had nightmares, others have struggled with guilt, and at least one wondered about their loved one’s soul.

Among the victims who spoke during Friday’s sentencing was a boy named Colton Sperry. With his head poking just above the lectern, he told the judge about his grandmother, who Sperry said was a second mother to him and died in 2019.

Her body languished inside the Return to Nature building for four years until the discovery, which plunged Sperry into depression. He said he told his parents at the time, “If I die too, I could meet my grandma in heaven and talk to her again.”

His parents brought him to the hospital for a mental health check, which led to therapy and an emotional support dog.

“I miss my grandma so much,” he told the judge through tears.

Federal prosecutors accused both Hallfords of pandemic aid fraud, siphoning the aid and spending it and customer’s payments on a GMC Yukon and Infiniti worth over $120,000 combined, along with $31,000 in cryptocurrency, luxury items from stores like Gucci and Tiffany & Co., and even laser body sculpting.

Derrick Johnson told the judge that he travelled 3,000 miles to testify over how his his mother was “thrown into a festering sea of death.”

“I lie awake wondering, was she naked? Was she stacked on top of others like lumber?” said Johnson.

“While the bodies rotted in secret, (the Hallfords) lived, they laughed and they dined,” he added. “My mom’s cremation money likely helped pay for a cocktail, a day at the spa, a first-class flight.”

Hallford’s attorney, Laura H. Suelau, asked for a lower sentence of 10 years in the hearing Friday, saying that Hallford “knows he was wrong, he admitted he was wrong” and hasn’t offered an excuse.

Asking for a 15-year sentence for Hallford, Assistant US Attorney Tim Neff described the scene inside the building. Investigators couldn’t move into some rooms because the bodies were piled so high and in various states of decay. FBI agents had to put boards down so they could walk above the fluid, which was later pumped out.

Carie Hallford is scheduled to go to trial in the federal case in September, the same month as her next hearing in the state case in which she’s also charged with 191 counts of corpse abuse."

The legal action comes as Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential contender, has intensified his pushback against Trump.

The lawsuit stems from a public dispute between Newsom and Trump over the timing of a phone call that occurred as protests took hold in Los Angeles over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement efforts earlier this month.

In a lawsuit filed in Delaware Superior Court, Newsom’s attorneys allege  defamed him by airing deceptively edited videos and making false statements claiming the Democratic governor lied about the phone call.

“Why would Newsom lie and claim Trump never called him?”  anchor Jesse Watters said in one segment cited in the lawsuit. Newsom’s attorneys also noted the segment featured a chyron reading, “Gavin Lied About Trump’s Call.”

Newsom’s attorneys argued the network attempted to damage Newsom’s future political prospects. “Individual viewers who heard Fox’s statement that Governor Newsom was ‘lying’ about when he last spoke to President Trump are less likely to support Governor Newsom in future elections and are less likely to support Governor Newsom’s causes or contribute to his political organizations,” the attorneys wrote.

Newsom’s attorneys also sent a letter to  saying the governor will drop the lawsuit if the network retracts the claims and Watters issues an on-air apology.

The request for $787 million damages mirrors the figure  paid Dominion Voting Systems in a settlement to avert a defamation trial over the media outlet’s 2020 election lies.

“If  wants to lie to the American people on Donald Trump’s behalf, it should face consequences – just like it did in the Dominion case,” Newsom said in a statement. “Until Fox is willing to be truthful, I will keep fighting against their propaganda machine.”

 rejected Newsom’s claims.

“Gov. Newsom’s transparent publicity stunt is frivolous and designed to chill free speech critical of him,” a  spokesperson said. “We will defend this case vigorously and look forward to it being dismissed.”

Newsom is suing  in his personal capacity. His attorneys include Mark Bankston, who represented the families of the children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School when they sued InfoWars host Alex Jones over his false claims about the 2012 massacre, and Michael Teeter.

The California governor has appeared on  in several high-profile moments, including a debate with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2023.

The moves come amid speculation about Newsom’s future presidential ambitions. Newsom, who is term-limited, has stepped up his pushback against Trump, a longtime rival, as California has become a target for the Trump administration. In his official capacity, Newsom has sued the Trump administration over tariff policy and the president’s deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles earlier this month.

Shortly after the lawsuit was announced, Newsom sent a fundraising email noting the suit in the subject line and asking for contributions to his political group."

The Danish government revealed Thursday that a broad coalition of legislators are working on a bill that would make deepfakes illegal to share and put legal protections in place to prevent AI material depicting a person from being disseminated without their consent. “In the bill we agree and are sending an unequivocal message that everybody has the right to their own body, their own voice and their own facial features, which is apparently not how the current law is protecting people against generative AI,” Danish culture minister, Jakob Engel-Schmidt, told The Guardian.

 

The Danish department of culture will submit a proposed amendment for consultation this summer. The bill, if enacted, would issue “severe fines” for online platforms that do not abide by the new law. The Danish government said that parodies and satire would not be affected by the proposed amendment.

The actions come as deepfakes have become increasingly common, affecting celebrities such as pop star Taylor Swift and even Pope Francis as well as many less famous people, and also grown more cumbersome to identify as AI-generated. More than 200 musicians, including Billie Eilish and J Balvin, penned an April letter speaking out against the use of AI, such as voice cloning, in the music industry.

Other countries have enacted some protections. In May, the U.S. passed the Take It Down Act, which criminalizes nonconsensual deepfake imagery and mandates social media companies to remove such material from their platforms 48 hours after they are notified of the deepfake."

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Gig work apps like Uber and DoorDash offer their drivers instant pay options for quick cash deposits. A recent survey shows that speedy deposits are not merely a matter of convenience; they're key to drivers' financial stability.

Everee, a payroll provider for gig work platforms, found in a survey released Thursday that 59% of drivers working on platforms like Uber, DoorDash, Shipt, Veho, and others rely on gig work for at least half of their income. And, despite gig work's reputation as a side hustle, that income isn't just spare pocket change; it's essential for drivers looking to pay rent or shop for groceries.

The nationwide survey, conducted in May, compiled responses from 419 gig work drivers. Nearly 7 in 10 of the drivers surveyed work across two or more gig apps each month.

""Really, they're driving for their livelihoods,"" Dana Gagnon, the CMO at Everee, told Business Insider. ""They're not driving for trips and luxuries in life. They're really driving to make ends meet.""

A spokesperson for DoorDash told Business Insider that their internal statistics showed similar trends. Forty-eight percent of drivers for DoorDash pointed to getting paid quickly as one of the top reasons they choose to drive for the app, with about seven in 10 ""Dashers"" expecting to use their dashing income within the week, the spokesperson said.

About one in four DoorDash drivers expect to use their pay within days, per the DoorDash spokesperson.

A Lyft spokesperson told Business Insider that roughly 30% of payouts through the app are deposited through its express payment option.

Representatives for other gig driving apps, including Uber and Instacart, did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Wyatt Taylor, a 19-year-old DoorDash driver, told Business Insider he relies on the app's partnership with Crimson to get his pay delivered directly to a personal banking account immediately, free of charge, after every trip he makes for the app.

""If you need to make something happen, like if you're needing to fill up your gas tank, then you're not having to wait till Monday,"" Taylor said. ""You can just do a DoorDash, and then after you're done, you can just go and take your car to the gas station.""

And that quick turnaround is increasingly important to drivers trying to maintain a longer financial runway, Everee found. The Everee survey found, in general, 65% of respondents had taken a payday loan or cash advance because payouts lagged, and 61% delayed paying a bill or making an essential purchase while waiting for their earnings to hit their account.

Stephanie Riggs, a 54-year-old driver who uses the catering delivery app, Dlivrd, told BI that, while she generally prefers to stack her payments for weekly cashouts, part of the reason she prefers to make gig driving her full-time job is the freedom in both working hours and payment options — so ""if I was ever in a situation where there was an emergency, those funds are available and flexible.""

Faster pay is gaining traction across industries

The demand for flexible payment options is expanding beyond traditional gig work, as well. Business Insider previously reported Gen Z is bringing a gig work mentality to corporate America, and some corporations are taking notice of the preference for more customizable ways to access their paycheck.

Tate Hackert, cofounder and Chief Strategy Officer of ZayZoon, a software company that provides employees with access to their earned wages before payday, told BI that many franchised McDonald's locations use his company's software, as well as brick-and-mortar businesses like coffee shops and home healthcare services.

He added that 55% of the company's customers are 34 years of age or younger, with women making up more of ZayZoon's users than men. Hackert said he believes the generational slant is driven partially by younger workers' desire for better control of their finances — a preference they picked up from gig work — but, overall, he said, ""it's a cash flow issue.""

""It's not always an income issue, although, of course, more income can always be better,"" Hackert said. Workers may have enough overall income in a month to cover all their expenses on paper, but may not have enough in their account to cover each bill at the time the balance comes due, making flexible paydays preferable, depending on each employee's needs.

Gig drivers with access to more flexible payment options also report better satisfaction with the apps they drive for, Everee found. Their survey found drivers who get paid instantly reported 13 percentage points higher satisfaction than workers on weekly cycles.

Hackert said ZayZoon has found the same, adding that the gratification of instant pay is a strong incentive for workers to pursue gigs like delivery driving rather than traditional jobs — especially for those who already have a full-time role.

""So if you're an employer, your competition isn't just the brick-and-mortar employer across the street, it's actually the gig economy,"" Hackert said."

left_lean,"There has been a great deal of interest in the Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez wedding, but one celebrity is apparently not attending.

The world now knows that singer Katy Perry is not in Venice for the Amazon founder and his longtime lady love’s wedding. Perry shared a series of photos and videos from Australia, where she is currently performing as part of her Lifetimes Tour.

Sánchez posted in the comments.

“We miss you Katy ❤️,” Sánchez wrote.

That was notable given that Orlando Bloom, with whom Perry shares a daughter, is attending the wedding. Perry and the actor, who have reportedly split, had been a couple for nine years and engaged for six.

CNN has reached out to representatives for Bloom and Perry for comment.

Perry and Sánchez were part of an all-female crew who in April traveled aboard Blue Origin’s suborbital space tourism mission.

The other women included journalist Gayle King, bioastronautics research scientist Amanda Nguyen, Aisha Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist and CEO of STEMBoard, and Kerianne Flynn, a film producer.

Bezos is the founder of Blue Origin and Sánchez, who is a former anchor and a pilot, organized the expedition."

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Laurie Schechter, 66, from New York, about working alongside Anna Wintour, who recently announced she would step down as Vogue's editor in chief to be global editorial director. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

I first worked with Anna Wintour at New York Magazine, where I was an editorial assistant in the early 80s.

When she became Vogue's creative director in 1983, I wanted to go with her to be a fly on the wall of her process. Though she wasn't warm and fuzzy, she was an incredible teacher.

I continued to work with Anna at Vogue for two separate stints, and at House & Garden, another Condé Nast title at the time.

Working with Anna, I got to know how soft she is on the inside. She's done amazing things for people in the industry, including me.

I followed in Anna Wintour's footsteps for a chunk of my career

Anna was friends with my friend before I worked with her.

My friend said Anna was looking for a new assistant at New York Magazine, and I should apply. But I didn't get the job. A few months later, that assistant quit, so Anna called my office and asked if I was interested. I said yes.

Anna is super organized and is clear about what she likes and doesn't like. She has a big-picture mind but also drills down to what's critical and important.

When she moved to Vogue, I asked if she could take me with her, and she made it happen. I took on a coordinator role, where I organized shoots and did picture research.

In 1985, Anna was made editor in chief of British Vogue, but instead of going with her, I went to work for Rolling Stone.

In 1987, Anna took over Condé Nast's House & Garden. I thought about joining her, but I didn't know what I would do there. It was Anna who had the idea for me to become a style editor. One of the great things about her is she can imagine something for you and identify other people's talents. I got to translate my passion for fashion to the world of interiors.

When Anna became American Vogue's editor in chief in 1988, she invited me to come with her as a style editor, along with others at House & Garden.

One of the first things she did at Vogue was talk to all the staff. She gave people an opportunity to see what she was all about. Some people decided not to stay on, but others did.

Anna may be prickly on the outside, but she's soft on the inside

Anna was very cut-and-dried. Once, I tried to do a page on a theme that wasn't Anna's cup of tea. She gave me permission to go ahead, so I did a shoot and brought it back to her. When we laid out the story, she hated it.

I argued my case, and she listened, but she eventually said to me, ""Laurie, drop it."" That's very much Anna. She gave me the chance to change her mind, but if something didn't work for her, that was it.

People called her ""ice queen"" or ""nuclear Wintour,"" but I actually think she has a maternal side she doesn't show to everyone. A prickly pear is spiky on the outside, but soft and sweet on the inside — that's like Anna.

I've seen her do a lot of things for others, and she's done nice things for me, too. When I worked at House & Garden, I eloped for my wedding. When I told her, she decided to throw me a private dinner at her house.

I don't think Anna's going anywhere

It's smart for Anna to get out of the day-to-day grind of being editor in chief of Vogue and still maintain a bird's-eye view on things as a global editorial director. She's a really good delegator, and I'm sure she'll make a great selection to be her successor.

I don't think she's going to disappear. She'll probably be in the front row of fashion shows up until she physically can't anymore.

Anna is a powerhouse and moneymaker. She's made the industry better in so many ways, and she should be celebrated.

left_lean,"President Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters Friday that the Supreme Court’s decision limiting nationwide court injunctions—which took the legs out of what has been one of the few checks on Trump’s executive authority—will enable the Trump Administration to enact its policies more quickly. The ruling from the high court’s conservative majority curtailed lower courts’ power to block Trump’s policies nationwide, largely wiping away a bulwark that has prevented some of the President’s most aggressive actions from going into effect.

 

“Thanks to this decision we can now promptly file to proceed with numerous polices that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis,” Trump said during a press conference at the White House following the ruling. “These judges have attempted to dictate the law for the entire nation,” he added, calling the federal judges who have stood in his way “absolutely crazy, radical left judges.” For months, federal courts have slowed Trump’s efforts to expand the use of presidential authority in order to eliminate federal agencies, slash the federal workforce, speed up deportations, and redefine who gets American citizenship at birth. The judicial pushback has been a rare source of restraint on the President’s agenda from within the government, as Republicans in control of both the House and Senate have not defended Congressional authority over federal funding. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned Friday that the Supreme Court decision is a “terrifying step toward authoritarianism” and “a grave danger to our democracy.”



Among the initiatives Trump will try to push forward now that the obstacle of nationwide injunctions has been removed is his directive to deny citizenship to people born inside the U.S., he said. Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office attempting to redefine who should be recognized as a U.S. citizen at birth, challenging a precedent that has been settled law since 1898. Trump’s order was blocked nationwide by district court rulings. But the Supreme Court ruled Friday that such court injunctions would only apply in the part of the country where they originated, which could lead to citizenship being granted differently depending where in the U.S. someone is born. Read more: What to Know About Trump’s Order on Birthright Citizenship and the Legal Battle Around It The Supreme Court will consider in October the broader question of whether Trump has the authority to redefine the 127-year-old interpretation of citizenship established by the court itself. In 1898, the Supreme Court ruled that the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which states that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States” are citizens of the country, guaranteed the citizenship of a Chinese-American cook named Wong Kim Ark. After a trip to China, immigration officials tried to deny Wong entry back into the U.S. under the Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred Chinese nationals from migrating to the U.S. at the time. But the court confirmed in a 6-to-2 decision that Wong was a citizen by birth, setting a precedent that birthright citizenship in the U.S. is universal.



Trump wants to unwind that precedent. The 14th Amendment was ratified in the wake of the Civil War to clarify who had citizenship rights and equal protection under U.S. law. Trump said the constitutional amendment wasn’t designed to broadly define citizenship by birth and instead was “meant for the babies of slaves.” Birthright citizenship “wasn’t meant for people trying to scam the system and come into the country on a vacation,” Trump said at the White House on Friday. Read more: Inside Donald Trump’s Mass-Deportation Operation Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the Supreme Court decision against nationwide injunctions will give federal authorities a freer hand to deport people suspected of being gang members. Courts have repeatedly ruled that the Trump Administration has overstepped its authority by deporting people without first presenting evidence to a court that they are public safety threats. ""You should all feel safer now that President Trump can deport all of these gangs, and not one district court judge can think they're an emperor over this administration, his executive powers and why the people of the United States elected him,” Bondi said.



In March, the Trump Administration deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador more than 230 Venezuelans from the U.S. that it said were members of a Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua. But the Administration has not shown evidence to a court or the public that all of those men were gang members or posed a threat to public safety that merits their being imprisoned in another country. On Friday, Bondi said similar arrests have been carried out much more broadly: The Trump Administration, she said, had arrested 2,711 people it says are Tren de Aragua gang members. The Supreme Court’s decision to hem in the lower courts may allow Trump to expand his immigration crackdown with even fewer checks on his power."
left_lean,"Greetings from London. A week of interviews, events, and meetings—both on the record and behind closed-doors—at the city’s Climate Action Week has left me with many reflections, but one stands out: the climate work goes on, but the U.S. is no longer at the center of the universe. That reality is evident almost just from the scale. The organizers tout 700 events and 45,000 participants spread across the sprawling London metropolis. This was the biggest London climate week yet, and the first time for many (myself included).

 

But it was also evident in the meat of the conversations. Investors talked about opportunities outside the U.S., particularly in Asia and Europe. Climate focused executives waffled about how much of a presence they wanted to have at this year’s iteration of New York Climate Week, usually an important moment on the climate calendar each September. And British officials emphasized their ability to serve as a global hub for sustainable finance. “As investors look around the world and they look for places to put capital, I think we sit in a very good position because of what's happening geopolitically,” says Chris Hayward, policy chairman of City of London, the historic center of London, now best known as a financial hub. Read more: How Soon Should Companies Prepare for a 2°C World? To get from event to event in London required dashing around the city in the quickest fashion: typically the tube subway system, consistently overheated given the unseasonably hot London temperatures. But the geographic center of the week was undeniably the City of London, the one square mile that hosts the country’s premier banking and financial institutions. There’s a reason for that: organizers in London see an economic opportunity in supporting the energy transition.



And that’s at the core of the global shift visible here in London. The companies that gathered this week have, for the most part, doubled down on efforts to make or save money with climate and sustainability initiatives—whether that’s an industrial company cutting bills with energy efficiency or a financial firm creating new products to allow companies to invest in renewable power. The reality of this profit-oriented approach means the U.S. will fall behind given the policy uncertainty. The observation was underscored by data released throughout the week. A survey of business executives globally, released by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and Bain & Company to coincide with the event, found that large global companies are continuing to invest in green solutions—but are shifting those investments away from the U.S. toward Europe and Asia. Three quarters of surveyed companies said they were increasingly interested in focusing on those regions.



Even still, that’s not to say that climate work in the U.S. is dead. The report from WBCSD found that 50% of companies now have less interest in investing in climate work in the U.S. That’s a striking figure when contrasted with the global picture. At the same time, it means a significant fraction of global companies continue to see potential. Read more: Brazil’s Finance Chief Sees Climate Change as an Economic Opportunity In background chats I had, many American business and financial sector leaders were quick to share that they continue to find opportunities to cut emissions in a way that saves them money—though several expressed fear that talking about it publicly could prompt scrutiny from the administration. “Businesses are not giving up on the decarbonization journey,” says Peter Bakker, president and CEO of WBCSD, “depending on where businesses are stationed, they are more or less willing to talk about it.”



And I was surprised by the response to my informal, totally anecdotal poll about this year’s New York Climate Week. In conversations, I asked sustainability executives how they planned to approach the gathering this year. While many said they had considered pulling out, the vast majority said that they have ultimately decided they still plan to show up—perhaps with a smaller footprint than in years past. The calibration of the message in New York this fall will be interesting, to say the least. In more than a decade on this beat, I have never felt more of a reluctance from business leaders to speak on the record. Many long standing sources preferred to talk without attribution, wary of the political consequences of speaking truthfully even while they eagerly highlighted their work to me. While that makes it more challenging to clearly tell the full story of what’s happening, I suppose it’s somewhat good news if your biggest concern is whether companies are still focused on capping emissions.

Some people go to Vegas to gamble; I go to eat.

After visiting Las Vegas over 50 times, my husband and I have a dining strategy: We return to a few of our favorite spots and then try a couple of new ones.

Here are some of my favorite restaurants on The Strip.

The Chef Truck is the perfect spot for delicious Cuban food at reasonable prices

The Chef Truck is hard to miss. Wendy Lee

As a fan of the movie ""The Chef,"" I knew I had to try The Chef Truck, a bright-yellow food truck parked inside the Park MGM.

The truck serves Cuban-inspired food and is a collaboration between celebrity chef Roy Choi and actor/director Jon Favreau that opened in late 2023.

I suggest starting with a warm sandwich, like the Cubano, and ending with the chocolate lava cake.

The prices are reasonable — every dish is under $20 — and there's a small seating area nearby, making this the perfect lunch stop between gambling or shopping on The Strip.

I'm a sucker for a restaurant with a view of the Bellagio Fountains —especially at night — so I often head to one of the restaurants in the Bellagio Hotel & Casino for a romantic dinner.

Lago by Julian Serrano serves upscale Italian fare, my favorite cuisine. During our last visit there, we shared the delicious seafood linguine and prime rib with peppercorn sauce.

Both were accompanied by a bottle of Chianti recommended by our server.

You can't go wrong with lunch or dinner at Giada's

We first discovered GIADA shortly after it opened in 2014 in the Cromwell. We had reservations for lunch and liked it so much we returned that evening for dinner.

Now, it's one of our regular dining spots. I always request a window table so we can enjoy the view of The Strip while dining.

The Giada De Laurentiis-created restaurant serves upscale Italian food. If we're here for dinner, we share the bone-in ribeye topped with a sunny-side-up egg and pair it with one of the pastas.

Ocean Prime is a splurge-worthy restaurant perfect for celebrating special occasions

In 2023, Ocean Prime opened on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Harmon Avenue — it even has a rooftop terrace overlooking The Strip.

The upscale restaurant chain is known for steak and seafood, and we dined here for our 32nd anniversary. We began with oysters and bubbly, moved on to scallops and martinis, and ended with warm butter cake.

Everything was delicious, and Ocean Prime had excellent service. It's a splurge — most appetizers are $25 or more — but worth it for a special occasion.

Catch is Instagram-worthy with seriously good brunch entrées and creative cocktails

At first, that made me doubt the quality of the food — but I've learned the food is even better than the decor.

On a recent trip to Catch, I got the best French toast I've ever eaten.

The French toast offerings vary by season, but the one I tried was filled with a delicious Meyer-lemon cream.

We topped off our meal with a couple of cocktails with fun names like Lush Lemonade and Detox Retox.

Bardot Brasserie offers a French-inspired brunch menu reminiscent of a Parisian café

Another great brunch option on The Strip is Bardot Brasserie, located inside the Aria Resort & Casino. The decor is all dark wood and marble, which reminds me of cafés in Paris.

On a recent visit, we started with deviled eggs topped with caviar and steak tartare — both were excellent. For entrées, I enjoyed the French omelet, and my husband got eggs Benedict with smoked salmon.

Although both items were delicious, I was especially obsessed with Bardot Brasserie's version of hash browns. The small, crispy squares of layered potatoes were perfectly seasoned, putting any other hash browns to shame.

The best New York slice in Las Vegas can be found at Secret Pizza

I'm not even sure the official name of this place is Secret Pizza because there's no signage at the entrance, and it doesn't appear on the website of the Cosmopolitan Resort & Casino where it's located.

What I do know is that this is great New York-style pizza, and we never go to Vegas without stopping here for lunch.

To find this place, head to the third level of the Boulevard Tower of the Cosmopolitan and look for a long hallway next to Jaleo. The line can get long, so come with patience.

You can order a slice or a whole pie. There's limited seating insid,e so we usually take our pizza and beer to the communal seating areas nearby.

Mon Ami Gabi has long been my go-to spot for lunch with a view

We've been eating at Mon Ami Gabi for over 20 years, mostly for lunch.

Located inside Paris Las Vegas, the French eatery has a patio directly across the street from the Bellagio Fountains. We love to sit and watch the fountain show while we eat. Showtimes vary, so I usually check them and make our dining reservations accordingly.

The food is French bistro fare featuring entrées like steak au poivre and trout almondine. We always start with a baguette and a starter, such as the chicken-liver-mousse páté, and complete our meal with glasses of wine or classic cocktails.

It's surprisingly easy to stay connected while on an international trip, whether you're looking for the most affordable and bare essentials or want as much data as you have at home with the ability to make phone calls and send or receive SMS text messages. That's why you should always consider one of the best international roaming plans to take with you.

There are several options to stay connected abroad. In my international travel experience, I've found a dedicated international eSIM plan offered by services like Airalo very effective. It allows you to use the domestic plan and carrier you want independently from your international needs.

Higher-end plans from major carriers and budget-conscious MVNO services also contain international features. After extensive research, it's clear that T-Mobile's Experience Beyond plan has the best international features in a domestic plan. US Mobile's Unlimited Premium plan offers incredible international connectivity for a budget plan. These can be good options if you travel internationally often and make good use of premium domestic features, too.

Best international eSIM plan

Airalo International eSIM data plan Airalo offers data-only plans for several countries and regions, as well as plans that include calls and SMS text messaging. Data is all most people need for maps directions, data-based voice calls with popular apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, and light web browsing to research destinations and attractions. You can still call emergency services in many countries, which isn't dependent a phone plan, but between your phone and the local cell service. Check price at Airalo

International eSIM plans from providers like Airalo offer data plans for various countries, regions, or even globally. They're especially useful for infrequent travellers who don't want to tie international connectivity needs with their domestic plan.

Airalo offers data-only plans as well as plans that include voice calls and SMS texting. In my experience, data is all most people need for travel essentials, like getting directions in a map app, light web browsing of local destinations, and using communication apps like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger to call or message contacts. Still, the option for making voice calls and SMS texting is there.

I've personally used Airalo's data-only plans successfully in Portugal, though there were some hiccups with my iPhone's iMessages. I don't suspect the issues I faced with iMessage were specific to Airalo. Rather, the issues likely come from whether contacts have my Apple ID saved in their contacts list. This issue would likely arise whenever you disable your US domestic SIM or eSIM.

Numerous international eSIM providers exist besides Airalo. After researching features, pricing, support options, and user feedback online, I found that Ubigi and Roamless are suitable alternatives if Airalo doesn't have what you need.

Depending on your data needs and the length of your trip, we think 5GB and 10GB plans should suffice for most people.

You can check how much data you have left in the app, which is handy for managing your data use. You can also top up your data.

It's not the end of the world if you run out of data and don't have the option to top up — you can sign up for a new plan, which requires a new eSIM. If you've run out of data, you need a reliable WiFi connection to top up or sign up for a new eSIM.

These dedicated international services only work via eSIM, so you'll need to ensure your phone supports eSIMs. You can buy the plan you want and set up an eSIM before your trip, and activate that specific eSIM in your phone's settings when you arrive.

Also, note that international eSIM plans don't typically work if your phone is locked to your carrier. Phones are typically locked if you buy them from your carrier. You can try contacting your carrier to unlock your phone before your trip.

I'd also recommend disabling your domestic SIM or eSIM in your phone's settings while en route to your destination (like on the flight there). That way, your domestic service won't try to connect to an international network, and you won't incur outrageous international roaming fees.

Even with a data-only plan, you can usually call local emergency services. However, emergency services may be unable to call you back if needed, as they won't have a phone number to call. Some countries may require a valid SIM or eSIM with a phone number, whether local or your home SIM — Nomad, for example, lists Germany and Switzerland as needing a valid SIM to make emergency calls.

Best from a major carrier (if you travel a lot)

T-Mobile Experience More plan T-Mobile's Experience More plan is an excellent for most people with good T-Mobile coverage, as it comes with unlimited premium data, a generous 60GB of mobile hotspot data, tempting discounts on popular streaming services like Netflix and Apple TV Plus, and comprehensive international features. Check price at T-Mobile

Overall, T-Mobile's Experience Beyond plan has the best and most international features compared to Verizon's and AT&T's offerings.

Indeed, T-Mobile's Experience More plan includes 5GB per month of high-speed data and unlimited SMS text messaging in 215+ countries and destinations.

Visitors to Canada and Mexico can enjoy an even better 15GB of high-speed data and unlimited texts and calls.

The more expensive T-Mobile Experience Beyond plan gives you 15GB of data to use in the same 215+ countries, and upgrades the Mexican/Canadian allowance to 30GB.

The T-Mobile Experience Beyond plan also includes texting, WiFi, and video streaming on flights. However, it's only for domestic flights on Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta, and United Airlines, so it's not something to consider for international travel.

If you need more data or the ability to make traditional voice calls outside the US, Canada, or Mexico, you can add T-Mobile's International Pass, which includes unlimited calling and varying amounts of data:

512MB (for one day): $5

5GB (for 10 days): $35

15GB (for 30 days): $50

You can still make emergency calls in many countries, even with a data-only plan, but some countries may require a valid SIM. It's best practice to check before you set off.

Best budget plan with international features included

US Mobile Unlimited Premium plan US Mobile's Unlimited Premium plan includes either unlimited or 100GB of monthly data and up to 100GB of mobile hot spot data. You can switch between Verizon's (Warp), AT&T's (Dark Star), and T-Mobile's (Light Speed) networks to take advantage of US Mobile's enticing international options, which vary by country and network. Check price at US Mobile

US Mobile's Unlimited Premium plan on the Light Speed network (T-Mobile) includes 10GB of data, 200 voice minutes, and 250 texts in over 180 countries. That's the most international features we've seen on a budget plan, and even beats the most expensive major carrier plans.

US Mobile is also incredibly flexible in several important ways. For one, US Mobile customers who typically use the Dark Star (AT&T) or Warp (Verizon) network options at home can switch to Light Speed for their international trip. Indeed, Light Speed has the best international features among the three network options US Mobile offers. If you need to switch to US Mobile's Light Speed network, I would make the switch before you travel to ensure it goes smoothly.

US Mobile customers who sign up for less expensive plans, like the Unlimited Starter or Unlimited Flex plans, on a monthly basis can also upgrade to the Unlimited Premium plan for a single month (or more, if their trip is longer). Then, when the trip is over, they can return to their original plan.

Those who have already signed up for a less expensive US Mobile plan with an annual payment can upgrade to the Unlimited Premium plan. However, they won't be able to downgrade to their original plan and get a prorated refund after their trip — they'll have to downgrade back to their original plan when their annual cycle is over.

Buy a local SIM or eSIM at your destination

You can find out if local carriers have physical locations at the point-of-entry, like the airport, or near your hotel. You can get a prepaid SIM or eSIM with your data needs, and plans often include voice and SMS texting.

You can also pick up a local SIM or eSIM at your destination; local carriers might even have locations at your destination airport. Business Insider/Thibault Spirlet

The major benefit of going with a local carrier is getting in-person support at a physical location. Online chat support is nice, but nothing beats face-to-face interaction, whether there's something wrong or you need a new plan to get more data.

Bear in mind that eSIMs bought locally, like those from airport vending machines, often charge a much higher rate per gigabyte than the providers highlighted on this page.

How we test

When possible, we test international plans in person by going through plan selection, setup, and the experience at the international destination. We assess the value of the plans, cellular signal quality, and data speeds while using map apps, web browsers, and social media apps.

For plans where we haven't tried internationally, we assess the international features across competing options and the value they propose. We also research user experiences across the internet.

We're currently testing a wide variety of international eSIM providers, and will update this guide with our findings.

Tips

You can activate your phone's ""low data mode"" option if it's available. It should also go without saying that you should connect to a WiFi network whenever possible, especially at your hotel (or wherever you're sleeping). For additional security, we'd advise checking out our roundup of the best cheap VPN deals to protect yourself on unfamiliar or public WiFi networks at home and abroad.

We'd also recommend downloading music from your music streaming service of choice on a WiFi connection, whether at home or your destination. That way, you can listen to music in a car rental (or whenever) without streaming and using data."

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

A new video shows how prolific jamming-resistant fiber-optic drones are becoming on the battlefields in Ukraine. There are wires scattered all over the place.

On Friday, Ukraine's defense ministry shared a video from the 63rd Mechanized Brigade of Serebryansky Forest covered in webs of fiber optic cables.

""Just imagine how many drones are flying here,"" it wrote.

This is what the Serebryansky Forest looks like now — completely covered in optical fiber from drones.



Just imagine how many of such drones are flying here.

Fiber-optic drones, which are connected to operators via a long, thin fiber-optic cable, can't be jammed by electronic warfare tactics designed to disrupt the signal connection the way drones that rely on radio frequencies can.

In the video footage Ukraine's defense ministry shared, clumps of wires can be seen spread across the treetops. The lines are reflective, and at some points in the video, the sunlight flashes off of them, showing webs throughout the forest.

Some areas of the forest are packed with tons of wire, suggesting many fiber-optic drones have followed those paths, while others are scattered about. It's immediately clear from the video that there has been significant fiber-optic drone activity in the area.

Serebryansky Forest is a large nature preserve in Luhansk Oblast. It is located to the southeast of Kharkiv and just north of Bakhmut.

There have been other videos like this one, as well as photos of cabling stretching across battlefields.

This new video highlights the expanding use of fiber-optic drones on both sides of the war. Last year, Russia first introduced these hardwired systems as a countermeasure to persistent electronic warfare on the battlefield, which Russia and Ukraine are using to jam drones and prevent operators from communicating with them.

Electronic warfare has had a serious impact on regular drones, negatively impacting strike and surveillance missions and forcing combat innovations.

Ukraine then began using them as well. At the time, it was unclear if fiber-optic drones were just a temporary fix that would be countered until something better, like AI-enabled drones, came along or if they'd serve as a potential long-term solution.

These drones, which have clearly become more prolific, are useful for short-distance operations, typically over more open terrain. In forested areas, they can more easily get hung up in the trees.

Earlier this year, a Ukrainian special drone unit told Business Insider that it hadn't seen widespread adoption of fiber-optic drones in fighting just yet, but in recent months, these drone systems have had an increased presence on the battlefield.

Due to the constant threat posed by these unjammable drones, Ukraine has implemented countermeasures like shotguns as a kinetic answer, shooting the drones when they get close to personnel. The shotgun is the best defensive option right now.

While countermeasures are in the works, Ukraine is also continuing to develop and use its own fiber-optic drones. The country's larger drone industry has boomed since the war began three years ago, with many drone developers working closely with Kyiv's military on adaptations and new hardware and software."

Microsoft is asking some managers to evaluate employees based on how much they use AI internally, and the software giant is considering adding a metric related to this in its review process, Business Insider has learned.

Julia Liuson, president of the Microsoft division responsible for developer tools such as AI coding service GitHub Copilot, recently sent an email instructing managers to evaluate employee performance based on their use of internal AI tools like this.

""AI is now a fundamental part of how we work,"" Liuson wrote. ""Just like collaboration, data-driven thinking, and effective communication, using AI is no longer optional — it's core to every role and every level.""

Liuson told managers that AI ""should be part of your holistic reflections on an individual's performance and impact.""

Microsoft's performance requirements vary from team to team, and some are considering including a more formal metric about the use of internal AI tools in performance reviews for its next fiscal year, according to a person familiar with the situation. This person asked not to be identified discussing private matters.

These changes are meant to address what Microsoft sees as lagging internal adoption of its Copilot AI services, according to another two people with knowledge of the plans. The company wants to increase usage broadly, but also wants the employees building these products have a better understanding of the tools.

In Liuson's organization, GitHub Copilot is facing increasing competition from AI coding services including Cursor. Microsoft lets employees use some external AI tools that meet certain security requirements. Staff are currently allowed to use coding assistant Replit, for example, one of the people said.

A recent note from Barclays cited data suggesting that Cursor recently surpassed GitHub Copilot in a key part of the developer market.

Barclays note, citing the Ramp Business Spending Report

Competition among coding tools is even becoming a sticking point in Microsoft's renegotiation of its most important partnership with OpenAI. OpenAI is considering acquiring Cursor competitor Windsurf, but Microsoft's current deal with OpenAI would give it access to Windsurf's intellectual property and neither Windsurf nor OpenAI wants that, a person with knowledge of the talks said."

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' attorney tried to turn the hip-hop mogul's indictment inside out in daylong closings Friday — arguing that his client's violence and drug use do not make him guilty and that the real ""winner"" of his trial is accuser Cassie Ventura.

""Cassie is nobody's fool. She is sitting somewhere in the world with $30 million,"" Combs' lead defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo told the jury in Combs' Manhattan federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial.

Agnifilo was referring to the $20 million Combs paid his ex Ventura to settle her 2023 lawsuit against Combs and the $10 million she testified that she was set to get from the Los Angeles hotel where Combs was caught on security footage beating her.

""So if you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie. Cassie, at a certain point, just flat won,"" Agnifilo said. ""And he's in jail.""

Like Agnifilo's co-counsel did in opening statements, he leaned into Combs' violent side, arguing that domestic violence is not sex trafficking.

Agnifilo added, ""Anyone who tells me, 'Yeah, Cassie, she's a victim, Cassie, she's naive, Cassie, she couldn't see what's coming,' let's look at the facts.""

Prosecutors have alleged that Combs coerced Ventura and another ex, who testified under the pseudonym ""Jane,"" into sex performances with male escorts. Combs would direct, masturbate to, and often record these marathons — called ""freak offs,"" ""hotel nights"" or ""wild king nights,"" prosecutors alleged.

A third woman, a former Combs personal assistant who testified as ""Mia,"" told the jury that he sexually abused her at least four times, including a rape she said happened when he crawled into her bed as she slept in the staff bedroom of his Los Angeles mansion.

All three women accusing him of abuse — Ventura, Jane, and Mia — were actually describing consensual sex and domestic violence, Agnifilo argued Friday.

""She loves him — you can't fake that,"" Agnifilo said of Mia, appearing to get choked up as he read a letter she once gave Combs, along with a scrapbook of photos and news clips from the 1990s.

""I hope it reminds you of when this world made your eyes light up,"" Agnifilo read aloud, his voice breaking.

Agnifilo pointed out that Combs is still paying the $10,000-per-month rent on Jane's Los Angeles home.

""He has a beautiful house for her child, who I'm sure loves and deserves the beautiful house,"" Agnifilo said. ""I don't know what she's doing today — I hope she's having a nice day,"" the lawyer added of Jane. ""But you know where she's doing it, and it's in a house he's paying for — and I hope they're having a nice Friday.""

In a rebuttal statement late Friday, prosecutor Maurene Comey said that Jane and Mia were not suing Combs, and that Ventura ""had already been paid"" her settlement money before she took the stand.

""If she made up a lie to get all of that,"" Comey said of the settlement windfall, ""then why would she risk it all by perjuring herself at a federal trial?""

Agnifilo spent much of the morning attacking Ventura, the prosecution's star witness. Ventura spent four days on the stand in May, detailing for the jury what she said were years of assault and sexual abuse at Combs' hands during their decadelong relationship.

""She's a woman who actually likes sex. Good for her. She should. She's beautiful. She's unafraid,"" Agnifilo said of Ventura.

""She wants to do it. She likes it. She's talking a lot of dirty talk. In this case, there's probably more dirty talk than your average federal case by a long shot,"" Agnifilo said, referring to sexually explicit text messages between Ventura and Combs.

Agnifilo, who referred to Ventura as a ""beautiful, sexy woman,"" also said that she has ""sexual confidence.""

At one point, the defense attorney read aloud an explicit text from Ventura to Combs. He prefaced the recitation by joking, ""My mother is so happy that I became a lawyer.""

After reading the text, Agnifilo told the jury, ""So I submit to you, she's not clutching her pearls.""

Agnifilo downplayed freak offs as ""threesomes"" and a ""swinger"" lifestyle.

It was a description that bore little resemblance to the trial testimony of Ventura, Jane, and two of the 30 male sex workers who prosecutors said were paid by Combs to engage in the marathon sex sessions over the years.

The two women described sometimes painful encounters that left hotel suites covered in baby oil, blood, candle wax, and urine.

Jane and Ventura told the jury that the events could last three days. Both said they took drugs, including Molly and ecstasy, in order to stay awake and dissociate. One sex worker said he had twice witnessed Combs beating Ventura during a freak off.

""They are swingers. They are validly swingers. This is their lifestyle. He wouldn't think in a million years that there's anything wrong with it,"" Agnifilo said during closing arguments.

""If he was charged with domestic violence, we wouldn't all be here having a trial, because he would have pled guilty, because he did that,"" Agnifilo said Friday.

Meanwhile, ""He didn't commit racketeering conspiracy with sex trafficking. He didn't kidnap anybody. He didn't obstruct justice, he didn't bribe anyone,"" Agnifilo told the jury.

""He did what he did. But he'll fight to the death to defend himself on what he didn't do, and that's what this trial is about.""

US District Judge Arun Subramanian has told the eight-man, four-woman jury to expect closing arguments to end late Friday.

Deliberations were set to begin first thing Monday morning. If convicted on the top charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, the 55-year-old Bad Boy Records founder could face up to life behind bars."

One of Millennium's top commodities traders is leaving the firm.

David Zimbler, a senior portfolio manager who ran a large oil-trading team, is retiring, according to people familiar with the matter. Some members of Zimbler's team will remain with the fund, a person familiar with the matter said, though it wasn't immediately clear in what capacity.

A spokesman for the $75 billion multimanager and Zimbler declined to comment.

Zimbler, who is 60 years old, according to public records, was based in Miami. He worked at BP and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange trading oil derivatives and other energy products during his decadeslong career, according to an online bio for a speaking event at his alma mater, Louisiana State University.

He isn't the only senior PM to recently depart Millennium's commodities unit. Pavel Favinsky, a senior PM who traded energy credits, left this spring after only a handful of months on the job. Tom Arnold, a senior PM trading oil, left in April.

The unit has also added PMs in recent months, according to a person familiar, including Harish Tulsi, a senior energy trader who joined from BlueCrest Capital; Spencer Schredder, a power trader previously at Citadel; and Rodolphe Tribolet, a renewable fuels trader who joined this month from Mercuria.

Commodities strategies have been a focus for billionaire Izzy Englander's Millennium and other multimanager hedge funds in recent years. But commodity markets have had a turbulent 2025 and are among the worst-performing hedge-fund strategies this year, according to hedge fund analytics firm PivotalPath. Trade tensions from President Donald Trump's tariff announcements spooked markets in April, and commodities-focused hedge funds lost 1.8% that month, according to PivotalPath.

More recently, oil prices have whipsawed in response to the war between Israel and Iran.

Antonia Rosa Salva, the owner of one of Venice's oldest patisseries, was approached two months ago to help create gift bags for a wedding in the city this weekend.

Two weeks ago, he discovered who it was for. He told Business Insider he signed some documents stopping him from sharing who the couple is.

But he's keenly aware of the controversy surrounding Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding, which is taking place in Venice this weekend. The A-list event, which will reportedly welcome 200 guests, including Bill Gates and Kim Kardashian, has drawn ire from anti-Bezos protesters and Venetians who are concerned the wedding will contribute to overtourism.

Despite the protests, Salva said that he believes the wedding is good not just for his own business — which opened in 1870 and has been in his family for six generations — but for Venice as a whole.

He said that the city's large number of hotels makes it a good location for large-scale events, which his business often caters to.

Just two weeks ago, he worked on an event with 400 guests — double Bezos' guestlist. ""Nobody protested about that,"" he said.

Salva said that anyone should be allowed to host their wedding in the city.

""Venice is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I think everyone has the right to get married, to come to Venice, or to have a party or stay in Venice,"" he said.

As for the mystery event, he said he was proud that his business was chosen by its organizers."
left_lean,"President Donald Trump said Friday he has put an end to trade talks with Canada and will soon announce a new tariff rate for that country, he said in a Truth Social post on Friday.

The decision to end negotiations, which have been ongoing for several months, came after Canada announced a digital service tax, Trump said, calling it “a direct and blatant attack on our Country.”

“Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately. We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period,” he said.

Trump has taken particular issue with DSTs throughout trade negotiations with other countries, commonly referring to them as “non-tariff trade barriers.” Canada has a new DST that is set to take effect on Monday that will be retroactive to 2022.

Digital services taxes are a way for countries to tax online services, in contrast to taxes on physical products. Countries with these taxes can collect revenue from large companies that operate online — even if the business is unprofitable. American firms, especially Big Tech companies such as Meta, Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are disproportionately affected by DSTs, according to a report published last year by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said on Friday he wants to continue negotiating with the US.

“We’ll continue to conduct these complex negotiations in the best interest of Canadians. It’s a negotiation,” Carney said to reporters.

“We knew (the tax) was coming. We hoped they wouldn’t do it,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday on CNBC.

“We think it’s patently unfair to do it retroactive. This is something from the Trudeau years, so we were hoping, as a sign of goodwill, that the new Carney administration would at least put a break on that during the trade talks. They seem not to have,” Bessent added. If the Canadian government moves forward with the tax, Bessent said Trump is prepared to impose higher tariffs across all Canadian goods, without specifying a rate.

Canada is the top buyer of American goods, importing $349 billion worth last year, according to Department of Commerce data. Meanwhile, Canada shipped $413 billion worth of goods to the US last year, the third-highest source of foreign goods.

Levying higher tariffs on Canada would likely cause the country to retaliate by imposing higher tariffs on American goods. That would take a toll on both countries’ economies.

Prime Minister Mark Carney’s office told CNN the Canadian government is considering its response.

In a social media post, Pierre Poilievre, the leader of Canada’s Conservative Party, wrote that he hopes both countries can return to the negotiating table.

“Disappointed that trade talks have halted. Hopefully they resume quickly,” he wrote.

Several Canadian businesses and groups CNN has spoken to have been pushing the government not to move forward with the tax, fearing they could cause trade tensions to escalate between the US.

“For many years, the Business Council of Canada has warned that the implementation of a unilateral digital services tax could risk undermining Canada’s economic relationship with its most important trading partner, the United States,” Goldy Hyder, president and CEO of the Business Council of Canada, said in a statement to CNN on Friday. “That unfortunate development has now come to pass.”

“In an effort to get trade negotiations back on track, Canada should put forward an immediate proposal to eliminate the DST in exchange for an elimination of tariffs from the United States.”

The Canadian Chamber of Commerce echoed those sentiments.

“Our position on the Digital Services Tax has been consistent, but primarily for the reason that it’s self-defeating in nature. That said, it’s a pivotal time for Canada-U.S. relations,” Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement to CNN.

“The tone and tenor of talks has improved in recent months, and we hope to see progress continue. We respect that Team Canada is conducting these negotiations at the table, and we need to give them the space to navigate.”

At the start of his second term, Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff across all Canadian exports, with rates going even higher for specific products.

However, as it stands, most Canadian goods have been exempt from those 25% tariffs, as long as they comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement he negotiated in his first term.

The biggest exceptions, with some fine print, are the 25% tariffs on all foreign cars, car parts, steel and aluminum. Trump later doubled the tariff on all steel and aluminum imports to 50%. Goods coming from Canada that were not USMCA-compliant have faced a combined 50% tariff rate.

In response to those auto tariffs, Canada levied a 25% tariff on US-made vehicles that aren’t compliant with USMCA. Canada also retaliated against Trump’s initial 25% steel and aluminum tariffs by rolling out a 25% tariff on roughly $43 billion worth of US goods, including whiskey, sporting gear and household appliances.

Dozens of other countries could soon face higher tariffs as a July 9 deadline looms for “reciprocal” tariffs announced in April to resume unless the impacted countries ink trade deals with the United States. It’s unclear if Trump will end up extending that deadline further and where tariff rates could end up. Several European Union countries also have DSTs, however, Bessent said on Friday, “We’re in active discussions with them to take those down.”

Stocks closed higher Friday despite Trump’s latest tariff threat. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which had dipped into the red after his post, both gained 0.52% to close at record highs. The Dow gained 432 points, or 1%.

left_lean,"The Israeli military has denied a new report that soldiers were ordered to fire at unarmed Palestinians waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza, after hundreds of people were reported killed while approaching food distribution sites in recent weeks.

On Friday, the daily Haaretz newspaper published an article alleging that Israeli soldiers in Gaza were instructed by their commanders to shoot at the crowds of Palestinians approaching aid sites, even as it was evident that the crowds posed no threat.

One soldier who spoke anonymously with Haaretz described the approach routes to the aid sites as a “killing field” where Israeli forces open fire even if there is no immediate threat. According to the article, Israeli forces recently began dispersing crowds with artillery shells, which resulted in a sharp rise in casualties.

“We strongly reject the accusation raised in the article — the IDF did not instruct the forces to deliberately shoot at civilians, including those approaching the distribution centers,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in response to the article. “To be clear, IDF directives prohibit deliberate attacks on civilians.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz have also rejected the report as “vicious lies designed to discredit the IDF – the most moral army in the world.”

More than 500 Palestinians have been killed as they approached aid sites or trucks carrying aid since May 27, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Palestinians have come under fire on a near daily basis as they approach the sites, health officials and emergency responders have said.

In one such incident earlier this month, more than a dozen eyewitnesses, including those wounded in the attack, told CNN that Israeli troops shot at crowds in repeated volleys of gunfire. Weapons experts said the rate of gunfire heard in the footage, as well as images of bullets retrieved from victims, were consistent with machine guns used by the Israeli military.

On multiple occasions, the IDF has acknowledged firing what it called “warning shots” at Palestinians approaching military positions near aid distribution sites. It has also said that it is examining reports of casualties, but it has not publicly released any findings to date.

According to Haaretz, the Military Advocate General has instructed the IDF General Staff’s Fact-Finding Assessment Mechanism – which reviews incidents involving the potential violations of the laws of war – to investigate suspected war crimes near the aid sites.

“Any allegation of a deviation from the law or IDF directives will be thoroughly examined, and further action will be taken as necessary,” the IDF said on Friday.

CNN has reached out to the IDF for additional comment.

Shots fired at controversial aid sites

The Gaza aid sites where the deaths have occurred are run by the controversial Israel- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which hands out pre-packaged boxes of food at a handful of locations in southern and central Gaza. The group’s distribution was chaotic from the start one month ago, with crowds of desperate Palestinians rushing the sites the moment they open to take the available aid before it runs out, often within less than an hour.

GHF was set up to replace the United Nations aid distribution mechanism, which Israel and the US have accused Hamas of looting. Hamas has rejected those claims, and humanitarian groups say most of the UN-distributed food aid reaches civilians.

GHF coordinates with the Israeli military to designate specific routes for Palestinians traveling to their aid sites and has come under sharp criticism from aid experts. It has acknowledged some episodes of violence occurring outside of its immediate aid sites, but repeatedly described food distribution operations as having “proceeded without incident.”

In response to the Haaretz reporting, the organization said it was “not aware” of the specific incidents described. Nevertheless, it added, “these allegations are too grave to ignore and we therefore call on Israel to investigate them and transparently publish the results in a timely manner.”

On Thursday, the US State Department announced that it is awarding $30 million to the organization, a sign of continued US support for GHF, which says it distributed 46 million meals in four weeks of operations."

Anna Wintour may be shifting roles, but she's not slowing down.

Wintour's decision, announced Thursday, to give up the title of editor in chief of Vogue, a role she's held since 1983, signals a colossal shift at the venerable fashion publication. Yet Wintour isn't departing.

At 75, Wintour is about a decade over the average US retirement age. She will hire a new US ""head of editorial content"" for Vogue, who will report to her. The magazine reported that Wintour would retain many of her duties, including overseeing the Met Ball, and remain as global editorial director of Vogue and chief content officer for Condé Nast, Vogue's parent company.

The move is the latest instance of a boldfaced name in leadership planning a shift in their responsibilities, rather than relinquishing them. Condé Nast did not respond to a request for comment from BI on succession plans.

Take Warren Buffett, who's 94 and the longest-serving chief of an S&P 500 company, and plans to stay on as chairman after he hands over the CEO job at the end of the year. Jamie Dimon, who's approaching two decades atop JPMorgan, has also said he could stay on as chairman even after he gives up his executive duties.

That can be good for individual leaders' well-being and for the entities they lead, though leadership experts told Business Insider that there can be risks from staying on instead of making a clean break.

Wintour has not indicated that this is the first step in her retirement plan, but in her comments to staff this week, she emphasized her desire to shape the next generation of talent.

""Now, I find that my greatest pleasure is helping the next generation of impassioned editors storm the field with their own ideas, supported by a new, exciting view of what a major media company can be,"" she said.

The benefit for longtime bosses to remain engaged is that it can be good for their sense of purpose and ease their transition to an eventual retirement. It can also benefit their team, as they have the opportunity to pass on a wealth of institutional knowledge to their successor to help avoid missteps.

""There's a steady hand at the ship while this transition is happening,"" Kevin Groves, a professor of management at Pepperdine's Graziadio Business School, told BI.

A longevity boost

Transitioning — rather than quitting outright — has other perks for leaders.

Jasmine Sawhne, a Los Angeles psychiatrist who helps clients with life transitions, told BI that type-A personalities who are wedded to their work tend to benefit from a gradual retirement rather than an abrupt one. ""Retirement can affect one's identity, their sense of purpose and daily structure, mental health — it is a huge, significant life change,"" she said.

At the same time, good cognitive health also makes it easier for people to keep working. A recent report on the ""silver economy"" found that in 41 advanced and emerging economies, a person who reached the age of 70 in 2022 had, on average, the same cognitive ability as a 53-year-old in 2000, making it more likely that they would stay in the labor market.

Suddenly withdrawing from a stimulating work environment can impact executive function and memory, which can trickle down to impact everything from a person's sleep quality to their sense of meaning. Leaders who have built-in interactions at work can also experience extreme loneliness when they quit.

For those with high-status roles like Wintour, a well-planned transition can be ""a really critical step so that they can avoid that post-retirement existential void,"" Sawhne said.

Many centenarians credit their careers (or similar activities, like part-time work or volunteering) with their longevity, keeping them mentally sharp and socially connected. From politicians and big-time execs to Tom Cruise, who's said he plans to make movies until he's 100, it's often hard for strivers to give up the roles they love.

Another perk of shifting responsibilities rather than retiring outright is preventing the ""emotional whiplash"" of an organization adjusting to a new leader, Sawhne said. It can also give leaders more time to train or mentor their successors.

She said remaining at the helm long-term can cause friction if the new hire doesn't understand how much authority they really have or who's truly in charge.

Gary Rich, a leadership coach who's worked with Fortune 500 companies on succession planning, told BI that it can be hard for leaders, particularly ones who've demonstrated long-term success, to give up their roles even when they say they're ready to.

Rich said incoming leaders often value having someone who's been at the job stick around for a bit to assist in the transition. He said that typically 20% of his work involves coaching the new person, while 80% involves convincing the outgoing leader to let go.

He said the reason is simple: High-powered leaders often draw enormous validation and self-esteem from their roles.""Asking people to let go of that is asking them to let go of a major part of their identity,"" Rich said.

The trick is, he said, not to stay too long. Rich said he usually advises no more than three months.

Planning for the future

As great as a soft exit is, the key is making sure it leads somewhere.

Rich said it becomes difficult for the new guard to establish power when the old boss hangs on, and members of the organization might still go to the predecessor through back-channel communications.

Nailing a subtle role shift is easier said than done. Sawhne said it's crucial to have a support system of people who can offer validation that ""you're not retiring from influencing some company; you're just retiring from the intensity of the work that you're putting in."""

An iPhone notification. A surprise Brad Pitt appearance at an Apple store. A fancy trailer that makes your iPhone rumble.

Apple is going all out for its big-budget ""F1"" movie.

If you own an iPhone or visited one of the company's retail stores recently, you've likely noticed the promotional push as the Apple synergy machine kicked into gear.

Apple has pulled many of its levers across various channels to drum up excitement for its latest original film , ""F1: The Movie,"" which arrived in theaters Friday.

It's a marketing flex that few companies aside from Apple are capable of, since they don't have the massive built-in install base of the iPhone.

Apple's strategy of continuing to make big-budget movies has some, including Business Insider's Peter Kafka, scratching their heads.

The tech giant's marketing push around ""F1,"" though, makes sense — Apple's got skin in the game for this movie.

Not all of Apple's marketing tactics have gone smoothly, though.

On Tuesday, some iPhone users took to social media to complain about a notification on their home screen that turned out to be an ad sent from the Wallet app tied to the movie. The promo offered $10 off two tickets to see ""F1"" when you purchase from Fandango using Apple Pay.

Sure, you could easily dismiss the notification and move on with your day, but some compared it to Apple's free U2 album that it added to iPhone users' libraries.

There have also been some pretty creative marketing efforts.

If you have an iPhone, you can watch a special version of the ""F1"" trailer in the AppleTV app that activates the phone's haptic engines (basically fancy vibrations), so that your device rumbles along with the vehicles' engines. (You'll also be encouraged to buy tickets when you open the app.)

And for even more immersion, Apple's Maps app allows you to virtually check out the famous tracks where ""F1"" was filmed.

Then there was Apple's big annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which took place in the weeks leading up to the movie's release. Its Formula 1-themed intro featured Apple exec Craig Federighi driving laps on top of Apple's ""spaceship"" HQ.

At one point, Tim Cook looks right at the camera and says, ""Yes, F1, baby.""

Apple Sports is another company-owned app that got the ""F1"" treatment. The platform helps sports fans keep track of scores and schedules for their favorite athletes, and Apple used it to promote its own sports film.

Exactly how much Apple invested to make ""F1"" a reality isn't clear. Initial reports said that the movie cost around $300 million to make (not counting its marketing budget). However, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Joseph Kosinski said that wasn't the case in an interview with Deadline last year. In reality, Bruckheimer said, the estimate was ""tens of millions of dollars out of whack.""

""We can't give you a number because that's Apple's money and they can talk about it,"" Bruckheimer said. ""But what I think you can say is it's quite a bit lower than what's been reported."" Apple did not immediately respond to a Business Insider's request for comment on the budget.

Some of Apple's investments in movies have proven success in the past. AppleTV+ made a name for itself in the film industry with ""CODA,"" a 2021 coming-of-age movie that went on to win Best Picture at the 2022 Academy Awards, making it the first film released by a streamer to win the top award at the Oscars.

left_lean,"The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a task force that recommends preventive health care services that insurers must cover at no-cost, turning away the latest legal challenge to Obamacare to reach the high court.

The opinion indicated that the panel’s recommendations – including pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a medication which vastly reduces a person’s risk of getting HIV from sex or injection drug use – would remain in effect, some experts said.

However, the case is being remanded to a lower court, where the recommendations could be challenged again.

Though the appeal never threatened to take down the Affordable Care Act, it could have had a sweeping impact on millions of Americans and their access to preventive services. Keeping the cost of preventive care free makes it more likely that people will get screenings and other services that are aimed at detecting disease at an earlier stage.

“This is a big win for preventive services,” Andrew Twinamatsiko, a director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University’s O’Neill Institute. “Over 150 million people have been able to access preventive services because of this provision. So this decision ensures that they can keep accessing those services without cost sharing, which is good for health and for minimizing death and disease.”

The Supreme Court ruled that members of the panel are “inferior” officers, meaning they do not need to be appointed by the president. The ruling confirms Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and his predecessor in the Biden administration, had the ability to name the experts who sit on the panel.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for a 6-3 majority that included both liberal and conservative justices.

The 16-member US Preventive Services Task Force, made up of volunteers, has since 1984 provided recommendations to the government about preventive services – like cancer screenings and statin medications to help reduce the risk of heart disease – that can improve Americans’ health.

As part of the nationwide health care law enacted 15 years ago during President Barack Obama’s administration, those recommendations are used to determine which services insurers must cover without charge.

At issue in the case were newer recommendations the panel made after the Affordable Care Act was enacted in March 2010. Preventive services recommended before then were not at stake, nor were certain immunizations and preventive care for women and children, which are recommended by other government entities.

The more recent recommendations include lung cancer screenings for certain adults, hepatitis screenings and colorectal cancer screenings for younger adults, according to a brief submitted in the case by Public Citizen and several public health groups. Physical therapy for certain older adults to help prevent falls and counseling to help pregnant women maintain healthy body weights are also among the other newer recommendations.

A leading health insurance industry group said policies won’t change, at least for the time being.

“With this ruling, there are no impacts to existing coverage, and we will closely monitor the ongoing legal process,” AHIP, formerly America’s Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement.

Kennedy’s power over recommendations

The Supreme Court’s ruling comes at a time when Kennedy has started exerting his authority over panels that offer health care recommendations for the public. Earlier this month, he removed all 17 members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which guides the federal government’s vaccine recommendations, and then added eight new ones.

The move has sparked concerns that the new panel’s recommendations could be more in line with the views of Kennedy, who has a history of vaccine skepticism.

“The big takeaway here is that the Task Force’s recommendations are binding, just as the ACA’s drafters intended,” Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan, posted on X. “BUT the scheme is constitutional only because Sec Kennedy can exercise near-complete control over Task Force recommendations. A mixed bag!”

Challenging task force structure

The task force structure was challenged by a Texas business, Braidwood Management, that objected on religious grounds to covering certain preventive services, including PrEP.

Braidwood argued that, under the Constitution, task force members must be appointed by the president with Senate confirmation. At the very least, the company said, Congress needed to affirmatively vest the appointment power in the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.

Before 2023, the task force members were appointed by the director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, an agency that is part of HHS.

The case, on appeal from the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, created an unusual political dynamic. Though initially appealed by the Biden administration, President Donald Trump’s administration has defended the task force since taking power this year – despite the president’s years-long campaign to repeal the 2010 health care law.

On the other side of the litigation, Braidwood was represented at the Supreme Court by Jonathan Mitchell, a veteran conservative lawyer who successfully argued against an effort in Colorado to remove Trump from that state’s primary ballot during last year’s election.

The fight over Braidwood’s religious objections to PrEP were spun off into separate proceedings. The dispute at the Supreme Court focused on the Constitution’s appointments clause, which establishes the president and Senate’s role in appointing and confirming officials that wield significant government power.

The Trump administration argued that the task force members were “inferior officers,” because they could be removed at-will by the HHS secretary and because the department appeared to have at least some oversight of the group’s recommendations. But if that’s true, Mitchell pointed out, then its members needed to be appointed by the secretary of the department, not the director of a subagency. The law is unclear on who actually appoints the board noting and notes only that the AHRQ should “convene” the group.

The Department of Justice said that, through a series of other congressional actions, the secretary effectively had the power to appoint the task force since the position oversees the AHRQ director.

During the course of the litigation, then-HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra “ratified” the earlier appointments during the Biden administration, but Braidwood argued that move wasn’t enough to overcome the fact that the law doesn’t specifically vest the power of appointment in his office.

The 5th Circuit sided with Braidwood, ruling that members of the task force are “principal officers” who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.

Kennedy v. Braidwood was the fourth major appeal to reach the Supreme Court involving Obamacare since the law was enacted during Obama’s first term and became a target for conservatives.

In 2021, the high court ruled that conservative states challenging a key provision of the law did not have standing to sue because they were not directly harmed. The conservative court also rejected challenges to other provisions of Obamacare in 2012 and 2015."

Pregnancy requires embracing a lot of changes — one of them being the fact that by the second trimester, some of your clothes will no longer fit. While it might be a bummer stashing away some of those favorite jeans or button-down shirts, there's an increasingly wider selection of bump-friendly alternatives, so consider this an excuse to treat yourself to a few new pieces.

To be clear, not everyone needs to go this route. If you strategically buy clothing that can accommodate the bump (and perhaps size up), it's totally possible to get through the nine-month stretch without ever buying maternity-specific clothing. That said, maternity clothes can definitely be a worthy investment. These items typically boast thoughtful design features to keep you cool, comfortable, and supported as you start carrying around that increasingly heavy cargo. And did we mention that many of them are even meant to fit you well after pregnancy is over?

Our favorite place to buy maternity clothing is Bumpsuit, the celebrity-favorite brand that makes trendy pieces that support your bump in styles. And if you're looking for affordable maternity clothing, we can't say enough good things about Old Navy's maternity line, which has great basics that usually retail for under $50.

After testing dozens of products from a handful of top brands, we found some winning items that are absolute essentials. And then, I've written about the best places to buy maternity clothing — even some retailers that aren't maternity-specific."

The most important matter, gray matter that is, sits right at the surface.

At least that's the line from Dr. Ben Rapoport, the cofounder and chief science officer of Precision Neuroscience, a brain-computer interface, or BCI, company.

""Many people have the impression that the data that we care about is sort of everywhere inside this dimensional structure,"" Rapoport, a neurosurgeon and engineer, told Business Insider.

That's a big misconception, he said. People often incorrectly assume that ""you need electrodes that penetrate deep inside the brain to get that information out,"" he added.

But brain implants don't need to be as invasive as they might sound, he said.

Precision is developing a thin film that sits on the brain and records brain activity in patients with paralysis. ""We implant modules of 1,024 electrodes on the brain surface in the area that controls movement, especially the hand,"" Rapoport said. That allows them to have cursor control, typing ability, access the internet, use PowerPoint, play games, and word process, he added.

These are actions that require vision, movement, sensation, and executive function — core parts of consciousness that are concentrated in the brain's outermost layer, the cortex, Rapoport said. Deeper inside are ""connections, you know, between those activities and also sort of subconscious processes, because the brain coordinates a lot of activities in the body that don't take place consciously,"" he added.

The New York-based startup, which received FDA clearance for part of its wireless brain-computer interface in April, has raised $155 million in funding since it launched in 2021. It is one of a few companies advancing this technology as part of the Implantable BCI Collaborative Community, an initiative launched in partnership with the FDA in 2024.

BCIs are largely classified into two categories: invasive and non-invasive. Non-invasive BCIs, which don't require surgery, often rely on external sensors to detect the electrical signals in the brain.

BCIs that are implanted record neural activity directly from the brain and are being developed to restore speech, movement, and other complex functions in people with neurological conditions. The buzziest BCI these days is Elon Musk's Neuralink, which has ambitions to create a ""symbiosis"" between the human brain and AI.

But there are a host of other companies working on BCIs as a way to treat neurological diseases, like Precision Neuroscience. The company has tested its temporary device in over forty patients in early clinical studies. Over the next year, it will prepare for the first human studies of its permanently implanted devices. ""There are certain internal validation checks and internal milestones that we need to meet for ourselves and for the FDA before we want to start implanting the permanently implanted wireless device in humans,"" Rapoport said.

The company's ultimate goal is to help paralyzed people get ""back to a level of functional capacity where they can be significantly independent, economically self-sufficient, and hold a job in the workplace,"" Rapoport said.

Correction: June 27, 2025 — An earlier version of this story said that Dr. Ben Rapoport was the founder and CEO of Precision Neuroscience; Dr. Rapoport is the cofounder and chief science officer. An earlier version also mischaracterized the film that goes on the brain. It is not studded with electrodes; the electrodes are embedded.

The story also clarifies that the implants are not a potential cure but a potential treatment for neurological disorders."
left_lean,"Venice, Italy, can expect to reap a $1.1 billion reward from Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez’s controversial, star-studded wedding, according to Italy’s Tourism Ministry.

The ministry said Friday that the event, which has been met with fierce pushback from some Venetians, could provide a boost of almost 68% of the city’s annual tourism turnover.

The three-day wedding, reportedly costing up to $55 million, has kept Venice hotels and other businesses busy.

Despite the economic boost, protesters have rallied against the nuptials of Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the third richest person in the world, and Lauren Sanchez, a former TV reporter, with one banner reading “No space for Bezos,” and a tarp from Greenpeace that read: “If you can rent Venice for your wedding, you can pay more tax.”

“We need to abandon the controversy and focus on opportunities,” said Daniela Santanchè, the minister of tourism in Italy, in a news release. “This is not just a private event, but a concrete driving force for the entire sector. Venice has all it takes to transform it into an opportunity for relaunch and promotion.”

The 200 wedding guests include A-listers Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Brady and Kim and Khloe Kardashian.

The more than $1 billion economic boost is about a quarter of what pop singers Taylor Swift and Beyoncé managed in the United States over their months-long tours.

In 2023, Michael Grahn, then-chief economist of Danske Bank, cited Beyonce’s “Renaissance” tour as a contributor to inflated hotel and restaurant prices in Stockholm. The tour added more than $4.5 billion to the US economy, according to a 2023 analysis of concertgoers’ spending by research firm QuestionPro.

Taylor Swift’s “Eras” tour, which ran for nearly two years and hosted 152 concerts in 51 cities, wrapped up last December as the highest-grossing tour of all time. The tour’s economic impact totaled roughly $5 billion in the United States, according to an estimate by QuestionPro. But that total only took into account direct spending, according to the US Travel Association, which estimates Swift’s total impact likely exceeded $10 billion when factoring in indirect spending and when non-ticket holders make purchases outside of venues.

The $1.1 billion coming from the Bezos-Sanchez wedding is more than the $1 billion Las Vegas generated from the 2024 Super Bowl.

Italy has hosted other high-profile weddings, including in 2014 with Kim Kardashian-Kanye West in Florence and Amal Alamuddin-George Clooney in Venice."

On the morning of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding ceremony, I wanted to ask Venetians what they thought of the spectacle dividing the city, so I headed to the one place I knew I'd find locals: a cafe.

Two things surprised me. First, rather than being drawn into conversation by a nonna at the next table, I learned that Italians drink their morning espresso like a shot at the counter. They don't hang around — certainly not for interviews (I suppose the clue is in the name).

Second, for some locals, the Bezos-Sanchez wedding isn't exactly the talk of the town.

I was in the branch of the cafe and patisserie Rosa Salva, near the Rialto — the central and most touristic part of Venice. Outside, tourists lounged with drinks and pastries, sunning themselves in ""Venezia"" straw hats and t-shirts bearing the names of other European cities. Inside, apart from the conveyor belt of Venetians drinking espresso, a few patrons had a leisurely drink while taking advantage of the air conditioning.

A waitress confirmed speculation that the other branches of the Venetian patisserie, founded in 1870, had made gift bags for the wedding. When I asked staff at another branch the day before, they were clueless about it — or at least feigned knowing nothing until Bezos' guests had received the bags.

Rosa Salva, she said, was one of many local vendors involved in the lavish celebration. (Later, when I bumped into the owner of Rosa Salva after much hunting, he confirmed they'd provided goods to a high-profile wedding, but wouldn't say which one).

By the restroom, a mother, with her two young boys on kiddie leashes, waited for her husband to return. They were visiting from Rome, she told me. I asked her what she thought about the ""big wedding.""

As she stumbled over her English, her husband appeared, and overhearing the end of the conversation, responded cheerfully: ""We got married nine years ago. It was a lovely day.""

Sure, there may have been a language barrier, but perhaps his reaction was more a sign that the ""big wedding"" isn't necessarily on everyone's lips here.

His wife corrected him. ""Not our big wedding,"" she explained, laughing, but the Bezos-Sanchez wedding.

Francesca Babolini, a Venetian photographer doing some work on her laptop at the cafe, joined the conversation.

I asked her what she thought about the Bezos-Sanchez wedding celebrations, which have been both highly anticipated and also highly protested.

""It doesn't affect us,"" she said matter-of-factly.

Later on Friday, a ceremony is being be held on a separate island, San Giorgio Maggiore. In this part of Venice, it will have little effect, she added, other than the presence of Ivanka Trump, more yachts than usual, and the occasional protest.

For Babolini, she said it's just another ordinary day in Venice. At least, in this part of the city."

The movie business is back — kind of.

So far, 2025 has been a relatively strong year for film studios. Through last weekend, the US box office was up 18.1% compared to the same period last year, according to Comscore. That's despite a rocky first quarter in which the domestic box office sank 12% compared to 2024.

""It feels like the good old days,"" film critic Scott Mantz said.

Still, the US box office is set to fall far short of the glory days of the late 2010s, when Star Wars and Marvel were firing on all cylinders.

Business Insider asked three box-office analysts and movie pundits about their top takeaways from the first half of 2025, and what lessons movie moguls should learn from what's working in theaters.

They pointed to trends like superhero fatigue and the strength of horror, and noted that the breakout success of ""Sinners"" showed original movies can be blockbusters."
left,"Four OpenAI researchers are leaving the company to go to Meta, two sources confirm to WIRED.

Shengjia Zhao, Shuchao Bi, Jiahui Yu, and Hongyu Ren have joined Meta’s superintelligence team. Their OpenAI Slack profiles have been deactivated. The Information first reported on the departures.

It’s the latest in a series of aggressive moves by Mark Zuckerberg, who is racing to catch up to OpenAI, Anthropic and Google in building artificial general intelligence. Earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Meta has been making “giant offers” to OpenAI staffers with “$100 million signing bonuses.” He added that, “none of our best people have decided to take them up on that.” A source at OpenAI confirmed the offers.

Got a Tip? Are you a current or former OpenAI or Meta employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at kylie.01.

Hongyu Ren was OpenAI’s post-training lead for the o3 and o4 mini models, along with the open source model that’s set to be released this summer, sources say. Post-training is the process of refining a model after it has been trained on a primary dataset.

Shengjia Zhao is highly skilled in deep learning research, according to another source. He joined OpenAI in the summer of 2022, and helped build the startup’s GPT-4 model.

Jiahui Yu did a stint at Google DeepMind before joining OpenAI in late 2023. Shuchao Bi was a manager of OpenAI’s multimodal models.

The departures from OpenAI come shortly after the company lost three researchers from its Zurich office, the Wall Street Journal reported.

OpenAI and Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

WIRED Featured Deals

Amazon Device Deals

Amazon's Eero Pro 6E (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a tri-band mesh that adds the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands. If you have a 1 Gbps or faster connection and lots of devices, this is a great mesh system for you. It performed extremely well in our tests, though the 6-Ghz band is short-range.

This deal is for the Fire Max 11 (5/10, WIRED Review) bundle, with keyboard. The Fire Max 11 is Amazon's nicest Fire tablet, but if you're thinking of doing work, keep in mind that Google's various office apps won't work. If you don't need those, this is a serviceable tablet. The screen is bright and sharp enough, the speakers aren't bad, and the cameras are 1080p.

Easily the best audiobook service, Amazon’s Audible Premium Plus gives you access to a library of Audible Originals, audiobooks, and podcasts, one credit per month to use on any audiobook title you fancy, and regular exclusive deals and discounts. Prime members can have three months for free right now (one month for non-Prime members), after which it costs $15 per month.

It may not be the best music streaming service, but Amazon Music Unlimited earned an honorable mention in our guide. Four months of free service for Prime members (three months for non-Prime members) will be enough to tempt some folks to try it.

Apple Prime Day Deals

The iPad (A16) (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has a USB-C port, a Touch ID sensor integrated into the power button, a 12-megapixel rear camera, and a 12-MP selfie camera in landscape mode (with support for Center Stage). You also get 5G on the cellular model. The A16 chip is the same one in the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15, and iPhone 15 Plus. It's plenty powerful, but there's not enough RAM to support Apple Intelligence, making it the only iPad in the lineup without access to Apple's artificial intelligence features (possibly a feature depending on your stance on AI).

Would it surprise you to know that this is the laptop I am typing on right now? Probably not. The Air is one of the most popular laptops around and for good reason. You get a powerful, portable laptop with outstanding battery life for under a grand. If your workload is graphics-intensive, you might want to go for the 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro, but for the rest of us the Air is the Apple laptop to get.

Apple's latest AirPods Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are ubiquitous for good reason. They've now got USB-C in the charging case, and this latest version sounds better than ever before. They have an IP54 sweat- and dust-resistance rating, and the noise-canceling is top-tier. Pair that with six hours of juice and a case with a speaker to help use Apple's “Find My” feature, and you have a winning combo.

The Watch Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best Apple Watch for most people. It does not have blood oxygen sensing, which is truly preposterous given that almost every other fitness tracker on the planet has it, but it can tell if you have sleep apnea, which otherwise requires a disruptive sleep test to diagnose. The Series 10 is thinner and lighter, so it's more comfortable to wear while sleeping, and it has fast charging, so it can track more of your activities during the day.

The gateway drug of Apple Watches, the entry-level SE is a compelling deal. It doesn't have the latest standout health features, but it's compatible with watchOS 11, so you'll be able to take advantage of the new Vitals app, and it has the S8 chip, which offers support for features like Crash Detection. It remains the best Apple Watch for the money.

The Beats Flex are the best headphones for Apple users under $100. They feature quick pairing, easy access to Siri, and seamless Apple Music integration, thanks to Apple's W1 chip, which ensures a rock-solid wireless connection to iOS devices. We were able to get 12-hour-plus battery life, which is good enough for a few workdays of tunes between trips to the wall charger.

The Beat Solo 4 headphones offer clear and buttery smooth sound, with good instrumental separation. As you'd expect, there's hands-free Siri and Apple Spatial Audio support, and they come with a compact carrying case for easy packing. Note that there's no noise canceling or transparency mode, no auto pause feature, or water-resistance rating.

For those overnight trips it’s nice to have a power bank capable of charging up your Apple Watch. This Anker power bank has a handy pop-up Apple Watch charger that can deliver 5 watts and supports Nightstand mode. It also has a built-in USB-C cable and a USB-C port, so you can deliver up to 30 watts to your phone or another small device.

Our top pick watch for Samsun fans, the Galaxy Watch7 features a nice rounded design—the accented 20-mm straps add a nice touch—though it is a little plain. This model infuses artificial intelligence algorithms to improve your health tracking data, like the Energy Score and updated sleep tracking capabilities.

Tech Deals

The Surface Laptop (7th Edition) is the best Surface device for most people. If you're looking for a lightweight and reliable Windows PC with good battery life, look no further. This deal is on the higher-end 13-inch model, with a Snapdragon X Elite processor, 16-GB RAM, and a 1-TB SSD. Performance was excellent in our testing, although this is not a machine for graphics-intensive tasks like video editing or gaming.

HP's Chromebook Plus x360 is a good 2-in-1 Chromebook. Its design is nondescript, but the Intel Core i3 chip is plenty speedy for Chromebook workloads, it's lightweight, and the 2-in-1 design means you can watch movies in tent mode. The speakers sound decent and get surprisingly loud, and the 1,920 X 1,200-pixel resolution is sharp on this 14-inch IPS LCD panel.

This Wi-Fi 7 mesh router offers expansive coverage and it very fast on all bands. You get a good selection of multi-gig Ethernet ports and it's easy to set up and use. The downside is the price, but this deal helps out with that. You'll need a HomeShield Pro subscription for online protection and full parental controls.

This little power bank has a 25,000-mAh capacity and can deliver up to 165 watts to two devices (it tops out at 100 watts for a single device connected via USB-C). The retractable cable is nice, and the clever braided 1-foot USB-C cable doubles as a carry loop. It has a display to show the remaining battery, charging rate in and out, battery temperature, and health.

Ugreen's 145-watt charger, with 25,000-mAh battery, is surprisingly compact for the power it provides. There are two USB-C ports and one USB-A port. What sets the Ugreen apart is that you can actually draw 145 watts while charging. That works out to one USB-C port at 100 W and the other at 45 W.

This Anker charger is very small (unfortunately, the plugs don't fold, see below if you want folding plugs), and supports 30 watt charging. That'll be enough for most phones, and can also handle tablets and even possibly low-power laptops.

This Anker plug is nice and compact, with a folding plug which makes it great for travel. If you have a phone that's capable, this is a nice way to fast charge, and this will of course be perfect for laptops, tablets, and other devices.

Outdoor Prime Day Deals

I’ve been testing smart bird feeders daily for almost a year now, and I can say definitively that no smart feeder is perfect. However, if you want something at the intersection of reliability, features, and affordability, this feeder, the top pick in our guide to the Best Smart Bird Feeders, is your best bet. This model is especially appealing as it comes with both a lifetime subscription and a solar panel to keep it charged. —Kat Merck

Hydro Flask has several types of bottles and caps available in a bunch of fun color options. You can choose one color for the bottle, another for the lid, and depending on which one you're getting, yet another for the strap or straw. In our years of testing, this has proved the most durable water bottle.

Ninja's cute and compact outdoor oven (7/10, WIRED Review) is temperature accurate, versatile, and adds a touch of smokiness without you needing to mess with the complexity (or size) of a full smoker. It's idiotproof and affordable, we love it for decks and those with limited outdoor cooking space, since you can do a lot of things with it.

Yeti reinvented the cooler, and we thank them for it. The rotomolded Tundra is built like a tank with 3-inch-thick insulated walls, and in our testing it kept ice frozen for six days in blazing 90-degree heat while stored in direct sunlight on Adrienne's deck. I (Scott) have managed to get five days out of it in the insane humidity of Florida in the spring. A Yeti hard-sided cooler is the best cooler around. Note that this deal is only on the one, wine-colored Tundra.

I like this Yeti for the wide mouth and heavy zipper that never sticks. It's free-standing, and at 14.25 inches wide, it's the perfect size for bungeeing to the top of a paddleboard or bike rack. It has both a grab handle on top and a shoulder strap, which provide plenty of points to carabiner a small dry bag or pair of flip-flops. As with the above deal, this is limited to a single color, “Key Lime.”

Of all the portable charcoal grills I've tested, the Weber Jumbo Joe remains my favorite. It strikes the best balance of affordability, features, and ease of use. It's big enough (18.5 inches in diameter) to smoke two racks of ribs or to fit burgers and corn for six people (admittedly, this was crowded) but small enough that you'll still have room in the trunk for a cooler and camping supplies.

Biolite's FirePit+ is a sleek, portable, mesh box with removable legs, a hibachi-style grill, and an ash bin. It has a rechargeable 10,400 mAh battery that can power 51 air jets for up to 26 hours. This allows you to precisely control the flame, and to some extent, the heat of the fire. The FirePit+ can burn charcoal or wood and, thanks to the fans, you don't need a charcoal chimney and you'll never struggle to get a fire burning.

Our favorite portable power station, the Explorer 2000 Plus has everything you need. It's got plenty of ports, supports fast charging, and the 2,042-watt-hour capacity will keep you running for days. You can charge it speedily from your AC outlet, but it also works with solar panels, like Jackery’s SolarSaga 200-W Solar Panel. Just be aware that it weighs a hefty 62 pounds.

When I'm not testing something else, this is the backpacking water filtration system I use and it's never let me down. It's our top pick for ultralight hikers and backpackers. It weighs just 3 ounces and has a filtration level of 0.1 microns (which gets rid E. coli, salmonella, giardia, cryptosporidium, and other common problems). The Squeeze also connects to any 28-mm diameter soda bottle (your basic 20-ounce Coke bottle, for example).

I have yet to do a trip with a satellite communicator, but I do understand why people use them. If I were to bring one along, this is the one I'd get. It's tiny, light (3.5 ounces), and easily stashable. It utilizes the super-fast Iridium satellite network, so you can send a rapid SOS from pretty much anywhere. There are extra features like waypoints and interval tracking, and it plays nice with compatible Garmin watches.

Best Home Deals

The Artisan is a design classic, but it doesn't just look great, it performs as well. It's got plenty of power, and the tilt head lifts smoothly so you can change attachments. You get four attachments in total, including a dough hook, a wire whip, a pastry beater, and a flex edge beater that manages to get right up to the sides of the bowl so no cake mixture is left behind.

The best budget Dyson vac, the Digital Slim is basic, but powerful. It lacks some of the features on newer models. For example, instead of a single power button, it still has a trigger you have to hold down while vacuuming. You'll do get a Motorbar cleaner head, a combination tool, and a crevice tool in the box. It's not compatible with fancier accessories like the Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head that shoots out a green laser to spot microscopic dust. We have seen the price dip lower on sale, but this is still a solid deal.

As seen in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers, Shark’s NeverChange doesn’t sport a filter you never have to change but it does last up to five years. WIRED reviewer Lisa Wood Shapiro found that this is only true in very small rooms, but it’s still a great deal on a decent air purifier, which now comes in fun colors like green and lavender. (Those ones aren’t on sale, though.) —Kat Merck

I love this pet camera from Petcube—it’s already super-affordable before the APD discount, and it has 360 PTZ rotation capabilities, 1080p HD resolution, 8X digital zoom, 2-way audio, and night vision. The camera feed rotates smoothly, and the wide fish-eye-like lens and panning abilities allow you to see pretty much the entire room. For a little over 50 bucks, this is the best camera you can buy at this price point. —Molly Higgins

This dual camera has 3K high definition, with 360 degree rotation up top, and a stationary camera below for even more coverage (plus it can be mounted upside down). There's also live view and two-way chat, night vision, and 6X zoom. AI detection alerts to things like barks, meows, loud noises, and fire, so you can receive notifications for anything alarming. I love that the dual cameras let me keep an eye on my pets (and everything else) while away, and at $60, this is a great deal for a super nice pet cam. —Molly Higgins

AirTags can be a bit divisive, but they’re the best way to keep tabs on your stuff if you have an iPhone. Set up with the Find My app, and you'll always know where everything is.

This is the best sleep mask overall. It’s affordable and stylish, with many different colors to choose from. It’s also soft, lightweight, and breathable thanks to its mulberry silk construction. The elastic band isn’t too tight and the mask does a solid job at blocking out most light. And I like that it comes with a drawstring case, so I don’t misplace it easily. —Louryn Strampe

GHD has something of a cult following due to its reliability and unique features like single temperature setting (365 degrees Fahrenheit) and fun little chime to let you know it’s heated up. We tout it as a more affordable alternative to the popular GHD Chronos (7/10, WIRED Review) in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, and at $73 off, it’s about as good a deal as you're going to find on a GHD. —Kat Merck

This cordless powerhouse is compact, waterproof (yes, you can use it in the shower), and charges fast in four hours. It offers three pressure settings, four tips, and a 360-degree rotating handle that gets into every nook of your mouth. The water reservoir runs for about 45 seconds per fill, just enough for a thorough clean. It also comes with a microfiber travel bag, tip case, water plug, and universal voltage. It's ideal for neat freaks or frequent travelers. —Boutayna Chokrane

There are countless Philips Sonicare electric toothbrushes to choose from, but I keep coming back to the trusty 4100. Its gentle vibrations are easier on gums than the more aggressive oscillating brushes. You get a two-minute timer, two intensity settings, and a pressure sensor to protect your enamel. Battery life is excellent, lasting about two weeks per charge, and the built-in BrushSync tech lets you know when it’s time to replace the head. It’s simple, smart, and under $50. —Boutayna Chokrane

We’ve loved the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends) for a while. It dries and styles in one go, with its 2-inch oval barrel and four heat modes (including a cool setting). The detachable head makes it easy to pack or stash in a drawer, and the ceramic titanium tech reduces heat exposure by 50 percent. It's a smarter (and safer) upgrade from the original version—which had recall issues overseas—and a cheaper alternative to Drybar tools. —Boutayna Chokrane"
left,"The included keyboard rest is optional to install, though the whole thing is designed to work together. It's a little annoying. I wish you could roll the tray into the riser to hide it, which would go a long way in making the FlexFit look a little more elegant, and could also help with storage. You also can't adjust the height of the tray, so while I didn't have issues typing on a keyboard, I found my wrist cramping up a little when using my Apple Magic Trackpad because it was a little too low. This may or may not be an issue for you—I'm 6'4"" and my limbs are weirdly proportioned.

The FlexFit desk converter ranges in height from 5.9 to 19.6 inches. That's a solid range overall (13 inches total), and I didn't have any trouble using the riser in a sitting position either. Crucially, my monitor has a height-adjustable stand, which helped me position it so that my eyes always hit the top of the screen—that may be something to consider.

The gas-lift height adjustment lever is on the right, and it moves the desk smoothly up and down. Even if you pull it, the whole riser won't crash down—you need to put a little pressure on the desk to have it slide. The whole thing feels sturdy without much wobble.

It's a black laminate desktop and a black metal base, all of which is fine, but a little boring, especially if you have a nice-looking desk. There's a groove on the desktop to route a few cables through to charge devices. Staples includes a few cable organizers in the box so you can route things neatly.

The FlexFit does the job—plop it on a surface, and you'll be able to bring your workstation up to use while standing, or down to use while sitting. Just remember that you shouldn't be sitting all day, but you shouldn't be standing the whole time either. Mix it up, and take frequent breaks with short walks if you can.

There's not much in the way of other features—it'd be nice if Staples had a monitor arm mount to pair with this riser to save some space. You can find cheaper converters from the likes of Flexispot, though I think the FlexFit looks better. Still, Branch's Desk Riser isn't too far in price and kills it on aesthetics. Staples has a better 5-year warranty, though. If you want to try it before committing, the return window is 14 days after receipt."
left,"For stains, cracking, sagging, dents, or anything of that nature that happen over time, you’re probably out of luck, as this is very much in the early-on sort of scenario. Similarly, let’s say that the stitching of the cover comes undone or it’s clear that the bed wasn’t put together the way it should’ve been, as it’s falling apart. This would be considered a “manufacturing defect” and also should be covered.

Here’s one very important piece of information to keep in mind if you find yourself dealing with one of these two categories: Be ready to prove it. Outlined in the fine print, and depending on the brand, you may notice that customer service mentions that images showing defects on the mattress will be needed. Some may go so far as to confirm what kind of bed frame or base you have been using, because warranty coverage does not apply if the mattress slats are spaced too widely apart.

Always use your mattress properly. If there are signs you were using it as your own personal trampoline park, the warranty is most likely void.

Pinpointing the Deals

Buying in person has its perks, too, and can’t be written off completely. The biggest one? Some folks just prefer to lay eyes (and of course, their physical selves) on a bed before buying. That is totally understandable. You may also have the opportunity to negotiate your final price, and it’ll likely go home with you that very day instead of taking a few days or even a week. Some companies will also offer sleep trials, like Mattress Firm. If you're going to shop in person, it's very important to consider the reputation of the company behind the brick-and-mortar location.

Plenty of online mattress brands, like Saatva and Casper, have their own storefront locations scattered across the contiguous United States. The beauty of having both an online and physical presence is that the deals can be lateral.

Saatva offers the same discounts online, in stores, and over the phone, so every customer gets the same price, says Gale. And there are often added discounts worth paying attention to: “At Saatva, for example, we offer special discounts to military veterans, teachers, health care workers, and other groups. You might want to ask whether you can get a bundled discount based on the products you’re interested in, like a mattress and base combo or a mattress and bedding bundle.” You can also shop at opportune times, and Gale suggests key holidays like the Fourth of July, Labor Day, and Black Friday.

Throw It in the Actual Cart

On the other hand, there are some brands that will put their merchandise in third-party storefronts. If you choose to go down the third-party route, make sure it is, in fact, partnered with the brand. Gale warns that unauthorized stores may sell mattresses with limited or no warranty coverage, which increases your risk if something goes wrong. This doesn’t always mean that you are covered under the brand’s warranty policy if you purchased from a partner store. Instead, you might have to rectify any issues like defects with the store itself. But sometimes, you are good to go. “Verified vendors also typically provide stronger customer support, more flexible return policies, and added transparency—sometimes even enhancing the manufacturer’s warranty,” he says. To figure out which of these will be the case for you, read the mattress warranty and policy information thoroughly.

Fine Print Reminder

So if you take away nothing else from this, always, always read the fine print of a mattress warranty. It’ll help you create a checklist of items to look for regarding the purchasing process. While this is additional work on top of figuring out the particular mattress you’re homing in on, it really aims to provide you with peace of mind. But if you're looking for a helping hand, not to worry. Our team regularly tests out new beds—we spend at least a week sleeping on any mattress before recommending it—to scope out what's worth the coin. You can check out our guides: Best Organic Mattresses, Best Mattress for Side Sleepers, Best Mattresses for Back Pain, and more."
left,"The new Breville Luxe Brewer is designed for hot coffee. It makes excellent, subtle, hot drip coffee. But it also does something that almost no other fancy coffee maker on the market achieves. It makes real cold brew coffee—the sweet and gentle stuff, the cool elixir of smooth summers and milky heaven.

The Luxe is part of a new generation of drip coffee makers that has helped transform drip coffee from bitter office fuel into a subject for connoisseurship. The Luxe's predecessor, the Precision Brewer, was one of only a handful certified by the Specialty Coffee Association to brew drip coffee according to narrow benchmarks on temperature and extraction. The Luxe, though not yet certified, brews according to these same exacting criteria.

The Luxe achieves this feat through a whole lot of technical sophistication. This means PID temperature controllers, tightly controlled flow rates, programmable algorithms for different water volumes, and the same thermocoil heating technology and pump you’d use to make espresso.

But the Luxe makes cold brew, blessedly, by leaving it alone. Real cold brew is made only with coffee, water, and time. Messing with this formula, or hurrying it up, never quite gives you the real thing. The Luxe gives you the real thing—holding room-temp water and coffee grounds in suspension for as long as 24 hours before releasing it into a waiting carafe. In a world of coffee makers desperate to screw up cold brew, leaving it alone amounts to wild innovation. I haven’t seen this function in any coffee maker not made by Breville.

The device isn’t perfect, of course. There are some quirks. But the Luxe is an impressive machine that keeps Breville in the conversation when it comes to the best drip coffee devices out there.

The Fast Drip

Before we return to cold brew, let’s talk drip coffee. It’s good. The Luxe is a handsome device, and also a big one: It makes 12 cups of coffee in a batch, as big as the biggest office brewers but much more gentle and precise in how it brews big-batch coffee.

The device is programmable in most of its particulars. By clicking the settings option, coffee geeks are free to create their own custom criteria, modulating the brew temp to an accuracy of a single degree. Other settings adjust the size and time of a pour-over-style bloom, and the flow rate of coffee through a shower-style brew head.

But most people won’t bother. If you press the “brew” button, the device will sense the amount of water in the removable water reservoir and brew accordingly. For small-batch coffee below 20 ounces, you’ll use a conical basket insert and conical paper filters. For larger batches, you’ll use flat-bottom filters and the default flat-bottom brewing basket."
left,"This story originally appeared on Vox and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Globally, humanity is producing more food than ever, but that harvest is concentrated in just a handful of breadbaskets.

More than one-third of the world’s wheat and barley exports come from Ukraine and Russia, for example. Some of these highly productive farmlands, including major crop-growing regions in the United States, are on track to see the sharpest drops in harvests due to climate change.

That’s bad news not just for farmers, but also for everyone who eats—especially as it becomes harder and more expensive to feed a more crowded, hungrier world, according to a new study published in the journal Nature.

Under a moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario, six key staple crops will see an 11.2 percent decline by the end of the century compared to a world without warming, even as farmers try to adapt. And the largest drops aren’t occurring in the poorer, more marginal farmlands, but in places that are already major food producers. These are regions like the US Midwest that have been blessed with good soil and ideal weather for raising staples like maize and soy.

But when that weather is less than ideal, it can drastically reduce agricultural productivity. Extreme weather has already begun to eat into harvests this year: Flooding has destroyed rice in Tajikistan, cucumbers in Spain, and bananas in Australia. Severe storms in the US this spring caused millions of dollars in damages to crops. In past years, severe heat has led to big declines in blueberries, olives, and grapes. And as the climate changes, rising average temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are poised to diminish yields, while weather events like droughts and floods reaching greater extremes could wipe out harvests more often.

“It’s not a mystery that climate change will affect our food production,” said Andrew Hultgren, an agriculture researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. “That’s the most weather-exposed sector in the economy.”

Farmers are doing what they can—testing different crop varieties that can better withstand changes in the climate, shifting the timing of when they sow, tweaking their use of fertilizers and water, and investing in infrastructure like water reservoirs.

The question is whether these adaptations can continue to keep pace with warming. To figure this out, Hultgren and his team looked at crop and weather data from 54 countries around the world dating back to the 1940s. They specifically looked at how farmers have adapted to changes in the climate that have already occurred, focusing on maize, wheat, rice, cassava, sorghum, and soybean. Combined, these crops provide two-thirds of humanity’s calories.

In the Nature paper, Hultgren and his team reported that in general, adaptation can slow some crop losses due to climate change, but not all of them.

And the decrease in our food production could be devastating: For every degree Celsius of warming, global food production is likely to decline by 120 calories per person per day. That’s even taking into account how climate change can make growing seasons longer and how more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can encourage plant growth. In the moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario—leading to between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100—rising incomes and adaptations would only offset one-third of crop losses around the world."

Fast-forward a decade and the prevailing new high-water mark is now the private suite with sliding doors, expansive entertainment screens and even double beds.

Qatar Airways’ Qsuite allows four passengers to dine together face-to-face, while Virgin Atlantic’s Retreat Suite offers an oversized version of business class that aims to blur the line between where the suits sit and first. At the very front of the plane, showers and private bedrooms have raised the bar even further.

However, as airlines continue to compete on seclusion, space, and spec, the business appears to have flown itself into a dilemma: If square footage is the ultimate flying luxury, now we live in a world where your sky space can be more akin to a bijou hotel room, what happens when there’s no more room left to give?

“Business class used to be all about hardware—the seat, the screen, the privacy door,” Nigel Goode, chairman of design studio PriestmanGoode, says, agreeing that the sky-high space race is coming to a close. “But now it's about human-centred design. The Qsuite that we originally developed for Qatar Airways broke the mold because it gives passengers so much more scope. They can sit as a four, they can be in a family, there's a double bed option. You can adapt your own privacy level.”

Airline cabins are becoming hybrid communal spaces where passengers can decide to be alone or interact with others—but now there's no more room to expand. Courtesy of Qatar Airways

This shift is apparently redefining cabin formats around intent rather than hierarchy, and unlocking new revenue models for airlines. Key trends? Technology that supposedly can reflect passenger mood, hybrid layouts that balance solitude with sociability, and sustainability as status with lightweight materials that tell a carbon story. Nippon Airways, for example, has just announced ""THE Room FX"" cubicle coming in 2026 for business travelers that despite the extra kit involved in being a private cabin seat, the whole pod has a comparable weight to the current Boeing 787-9 business class seat."
left,"Before Duolingo wiped its videos from TikTok and Instagram in mid-May, social media engagement was one of the language-learning app’s most recognizable qualities. Its green owl mascot had gone viral multiple times and was well known to younger users—a success story other marketers envied.

But, when news got out that Duolingo was making the switch to become an “AI-first” company, planning to replace contractors who work on tasks generative AI could automate, public perception of the brand soured.

Young people started posting on social media about how they were outraged at Duolingo as they performatively deleted the app—even if it meant losing the precious streak awards they earned through continued, daily usage. The comments on Duolingo’s TikTok posts in the days after the announcement were filled with rage, primarily focused on a single aspect: workers being replaced with automation.

The negative response online is indicative of a larger trend: Right now, though a growing number of Americans use ChatGPT, many people are sick of AI’s encroachment into their lives and are ready to fight back.

When reached for comment, Duolingo spokesperson Sam Dalsimer stressed that “AI isn’t replacing our staff” and said all AI-generated content on the platform would be created “under the direction and guidance of our learning experts.” The company's plan is still to reduce its use of non-staff contractors for tasks that can be automated using generative AI.

Duolingo’s embrace of workplace automation is part of a broad shift within the tech industry. Leaders at Klarna, a buy now, pay later service, and Salesforce, a software company, have also made sweeping statements about AI reducing the need for new hires in roles like customer service and engineering. These decisions were being made at the same time as developers sold “agents,” which are designed to automate software tasks, as a way to reduce the amount of workers needed to complete certain tasks.

Still, the potential threat of bosses attempting to replace human workers with AI agents is just one of many compounding reasons people are critical of generative AI. Add that to the error-ridden outputs, the environmental damage, the potential mental health impacts for users, and the concerns about copyright violations when AI tools are trained on existing works.

Many people were initially in awe of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools when they first arrived in late 2022. You could make a cartoon of a duck riding a motorcycle! But soon artists started speaking out, noting that their visual and textual works were being scraped to train these systems. The pushback from the creative community ramped up during the 2023 Hollywood writer's strike, and continued to accelerate through the current wave of copyright lawsuits brought by publishers, creatives, and Hollywood studios.

Right now, the general vibe aligns even more with the side of impacted workers. “I think there is a new sort of ambient animosity towards the AI systems,” says Brian Merchant, former WIRED contributor and author of Blood in the Machine, a book about the Luddites rebelling against worker-replacing technology. “AI companies have speedrun the Silicon Valley trajectory.”"
left,"WIRED published a shocking investigation this week based on records, including audio recordings, of hundreds of emergency calls from United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers. The calls—which include reports of incidents of staff sexual assaults, suicide attempts, and head injuries—indicate a system inundated by life-threatening incidents, delayed treatment, and overcrowding.

In a 6-3 decision on Friday, the US Supreme Court upheld a Texas porn ID law, finding that age verification for explicit sites is constitutional. In a dissent, Justice Elena Kagan warned that this determination ignores First Amendment precedent and will have privacy implications for adults.

Looking at the US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites last weekend, President Donald Trump posted initial announcements of the strikes on the social Network Truth Social, which then began suffering intermittent outages. And WIRED reported on assessments of the damage to the nuclear sites based on satellite photos taken before and after the bombing.

Meanwhile, Taiwan is scrambling to make its own unmanned aerial vehicles domestically as drones increasingly become a crucial weapon of war. The urgency comes as a potential conflict with China looms. And Telegram launched a purge of Chinese cryptocurrency markets last month, banning black markets that sold tens of billions of dollars in crypto-scam-related services. Now, though, the markets are rebranding and bouncing back with no further action from the communication platform.

But wait, there’s more! Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is now using a mobile app called Mobile Fortify that allegedly allows agents to identify individuals by pointing a smartphone at their face or capturing contactless fingerprints, 404 Media reports. The app reportedly taps into government databases, including Customs and Border Protection’s Traveler Verification Service and a DHS biometric intelligence system, in an attempt to match facial images taken in the field against prior government-collected records. ICE says the tool is intended to help officers identify “unknown subjects,” but civil liberties advocates tell 404 Media that it may open the door to surveillance-driven profiling and wrongful arrests.

Nathan Freed Wessler of the ACLU told the site, “Face recognition technology is notoriously unreliable, frequently generating false matches and resulting in a number of known wrongful arrests across the country. Immigration agents relying on this technology to try to identify people on the street is a recipe for disaster. Congress has never authorized DHS to use face recognition technology in this way, and the agency should shut this dangerous experiment down.""

Global law enforcement this week announced the bust of a group of alleged cybercriminal hackers accused of carrying out years of profit-focused data breaches and running a notorious cybercriminal forum and market known as Breachforums. French authorities arrested four members of the group who went by the names “ShinyHunters,” “Hollow,” “Noct,” and “Depressed,” though the police sources who shared the news with the French newspaper Le Parisien didn’t reveal the suspects’ real names. The US Justice Department, meanwhile, criminally charged Kai West, a young British man, with carrying out a broad, years-long hacking spree under the handle “Intelbroker” that inflicted $25 million total damage against victims before he was arrested in February. In addition to hacking and selling vast troves of stolen data, the group—or at least some subset of its members—appears to have served as administrators for Breachforums, a notorious sales forum for cybercriminal information and tools that was shut down in a law enforcement operation in 2023 but was later relaunched by its staff.

The loose cybercriminal gang known as Scattered Spider has carried out data theft and ransomware incidents for years, most recently targeting the grocery industry, other retailers, and the insurance industry in the US and the UK. Now cybersecurity analysts at Mandiant and Palo Alto Networks say the group is turning their attention to the aviation and transportation sector. Specifically, hackers were behind a cybersecurity incident last week that took down some IT systems and the mobile app for Canadian airline WestJet, Axios reports. Now Hawaiian Airlines has said it’s experiencing a “cybersecurity incident” affecting its network, though it hasn’t yet revealed more details or any evidence that Scattered Spider is responsible. Cybersecurity firms tracking the group warn that other potential aviation and transportation industry targets should be on the lookout for the group, which often uses sophisticated social engineering to trick staff into letting them bypass multi-factor authentication and gain a foothold on target systems.

Here’s a curiosity that we missed a couple weeks ago: A rare industrial control system hijacking incident in which an unknown hacker appears to have messed with the computer systems that control the Lake Risevatnet dam in southwest Norway, opening a valve to its maximum setting. The tampering, the motivation for which was far from clear, increased the dam’s water flow by nearly 500 liters a second, but didn’t come close to approaching a dangerous level. No one appears to have spotted the change for close to four hours. Officials told the Norwegian energy news outlet Energiteknikk, which broke the story, that a weak password on a web-accessible control panel allowed the unauthorized access."
left,"If there is a defining characteristic of President Donald Trump’s second term — aside from shameless self-enrichment out of the executive branch — I’d argue it’s the proliferation of unabashed and outspoken racism espoused by the president and many of his most loyal followers.

The online attacks launched by Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., against New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani demonstrated this in stark relief, such as here:

As did many of the other GOP responses to Mamdani’s Democratic primary victory this week, which my MSNBC colleague Steve Benen highlighted for MaddowBlog. This reactionary post from Charlie Kirk, which reads like Ku Klux Klan propaganda, is a prime example:

During a recent conversation with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, author Ta-Nehisi Coates said that one of the Civil Rights Movement’s greatest successes has fallen apart in the Trump era: People no longer feel ashamed to express “open bigotry.” Coates added that one of Trump’s most successful political instincts has been his bet that conservative voters are broadly more comfortable with the racist rhetoric that previous Republicans have flirted with a bit more obliquely.

Indeed, this administration has spent its opening months seemingly grooming the MAGA movement to be OK with blatant racism — or, at minimum, accept it as a natural part of political discourse. Even when compared with Trump’s first administration, which promoted diversity programs and parted ways with a speechwriter after it was revealed he spoke at a conference attended by white nationalists, Trump 2.0 has been far more permissive of unabashed bigotry.

Indeed, this administration has spent its opening months seemingly grooming the MAGA movement to be OK with blatant racism.

Trump welcomed the aforementioned speechwriter, Darren Beattie, into his second administration despite the fact that he wrote last year that “competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work.” Trump’s administration rehired after initially firing a Department of Government Efficiency staffer who had called for the normalization of Indian hate. And a host of other figures in the administration have a history of promoting various other blatantly bigoted ideas.

Trump himself has peddled false claims, spread broadly by white nationalists, that white people are facing systemic oppression in South Africa, and he has targeted an exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum that discredits racist pseudoscience. Trump’s Department of Homeland Security itself has spread propaganda promoted by overtly racist social media accounts, and his White House has frequently relied on cruel memes meant to dehumanize and mock nonwhite immigrants.

To be clear, MAGA racism is not a new phenomenon. But the president certainly seems to have given his followers a green light to embrace and express any racist hate they may be feeling. And all of this has the feel of a far-right psyop — as if the administration is attempting to train Americans’ gag reflexes in such a way that grotesque exhibitions of bigotry that may have made them squeamish in the past no longer do so."
left,"The private equity industry wants to get into your 401(k). The industry is lobbying the Trump administration to issue an executive order that would open the way for retirement plans to add private equity investments. The effort brings to mind Groucho Marx’s famous observation, “I don’t want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member.” Why would this supposedly elite investment class want the Trump administration to make it easier for small-time savers to invest in their offerings?

The answer, as you might suspect, is nothing good.

Before I proceed further, some explanations are in order. Private equity consists of companies and other investments controlled by private firms, which are almost always acquired with significant amounts of debt — hence the term “leveraged buyout.” The stated idea is to buy a company, overhaul its underlying finances, and then sell it again within a few years at a profit.

The private equity industry boomed following the 2008 financial crisis, when consistently low interest rates facilitated mergers and acquisitions. While the industry blamed then-Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan and the Biden administration’s tougher antitrust enforcement for the end of the M&A boom, the real culprit was the return of high interest rates and private equity shops overvaluing their holdings. Unable to sell many of their holdings at the price they would like, and short of traditional institutional investors in their funds, where can private equity turn? I’m afraid that this is where you enter the picture.

The industry has every reason to expect help from this White House. Republicans in Congress have already placed a provision in Trump’s big, beautiful budget bill that would increase the tax break for interest payments on the leveraged buyouts that private equity loves. And toward the end of Trump’s first term, his administration loosened regulations surrounding 401(k) accounts, agreeing with industry lobbyists that the arena met the standard of a “prudent” investment for retirement savers.

To be clear, in the view of many, it is not. The Biden administration, for instance, backtracked on much of the previous Trump-era guidance. And employers, who are considered fiduciaries for worker retirement accounts and can find themselves in court battling their former employees if things don’t work out, didn’t exactly race in to offer up private equity offerings in 401(k) accounts.

Champions of private equity claim that with promising startups and other companies less likely to go public than in the past, private equity could give mom-and-pop savers access to greater diversity in their portfolios as well as the possibility of higher returns.

The reality is different. The industry is famously opaque, and its high fees cannibalize much of the gains. “PE funds may look good on paper since they place a high value on their unsold companies, but this is not money that investors can take to the bank,” says Eileen Appelbaum, the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “Since mid-2022, the companies in private equity portfolios have been overvalued, and PE funds have been unable to sell them at the price they are demanding.”

The result is a poor investment — except for the fat cats collecting management fees on it, that is. A recent analysis found that the S&P 500 returned better results than private equity over a one-, three-, five-, and 10-year period. Multiple other studies have yielded similar results.

Compounding this: The private equity model can be horrible for consumers and employees of the companies acquired and owned in this fashion. That’s because the debt to acquire the company isn’t the responsibility of the private equity firms, their partners or principals. It is, instead, a dead weight on the books of the company unfortunate enough to be purchased in this way, often leading to service and staff cutbacks, price increases and selling off companies piecemeal.

Private equity-controlled companies are more likely to declare bankruptcy than those with different ownership structures, and those filings are hovering at record rates. Of the 10 largest corporate bankruptcies in the first quarter of 2025, seven companies were owned by private equity. Think Forever 21. Think Joann, the fabrics and crafts chain. Think Prospect Medical Holdings, which owns more than dozen hospitals. In fact, health care companies controlled by private equity charge higher prices, yet their patients have higher rates of accidents, complications and deaths.

In other words, private equity all too often acts as an economic scavenger and parasite. The efficiencies of scale the industry claims it can find can literally be deadly. And for what? To make some fabulously wealthy members of the investment class even wealthier?

Nonetheless, now with Trump back in the White House, the financial services industry is racing in to make private equity in your retirement accounts a reality. Earlier this week, BlackRock announced it was debuting a target date fund that would include stocks, bonds and private equity and credit investments. This follows similar moves by State Street and retirement plan provider Empower.

Again, none of this is appropriate for savings that are supposed to let Americans enjoy a stable retirement. This won’t end well — for you, that is. Private equity is a club, and you don’t want it to accept you as a member."
left,"Only in the Trump administration could the appointment of a  host to a high-level law enforcement position be seen as an improvement.

And yet, President Donald Trump’s nomination of Jeanine Pirro to serve as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia is in some ways preferable to Ed Martin, his (failed) first choice. Martin was an election denier who supported the “Stop the Steal” movement and provided legal representation to some of the defendants charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. Trump appointed him interim U.S. attorney for D.C. in January. Martin proceeded to fire and demote prosecutors who worked on cases involving Jan. 6 defendants. His aggressive use of the social media platform X suggested a prosecutor more bent on retribution and culture wars than on law and order. Martin sent official letters demanding answers from Democratic politicians for their statements about Trump and targeted Georgetown University Law Center for its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.

Trump’s nomination of Jeanine Pirro to serve as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia is in some ways preferable to Ed Martin, his (failed) first choice.

When it became clear that Martin would fail to garner enough votes for confirmation in even a GOP-led Senate because of his role in the events of Jan. 6, Trump withdrew the nomination. Martin was instead appointed to serve in positions that required no Senate confirmation — pardon attorney and head of the DOJ’s Justice Department’s ""Weaponization Working Group"" created to investigate special counsel Jack Smith and others who assisted in investigations against Trump.

Trump named Pirro as Martin’s replacement, first on an interim basis and last week to the permanent position. Unlike Martin, Pirro has serious prosecution experience, having served as domestic violence prosecutor before becoming a judge and then district attorney for Westchester County, New York, a position to which she was elected three times. She has not worked as a prosecutor in 20 years, though, stepping down from her position to run for Senate against Hillary Clinton back in 2006.

Nevertheless, Pirro, 73, has plenty of what Trump seems to prize most — loyalty. Pirro’s ex-husband, Albert J. Pirro Jr., previously served as Trump’s lawyer. On , Pirro has established herself as a reliable supporter, channeling Trump’s combative style. In 2016, she called Trump’s “Access Hollywood” comments “disgusting” but notably said she would still support him. After the 2020 election, Pirro’s show aired false claims alleging election irregularities by Dominion Voting Systems, leading to her inclusion in a defamation lawsuit that resulted in  having to pay a $787 million settlement. She called the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol a political “narrative,” as CNN notes, and demanded investigations into the DOJ and Capitol Police. This unwavering loyalty was rewarded in 2021 when Trump pardoned Albert Pirro, who had been convicted of tax evasion and conspiracy in 2000.

So, yes, Pirro may be more qualified than Martin. But choosing between the two is a little like trying to decide if it’s better to lose your home in a fire or in a hurricane. Both are devastating.

Despite her experience as a prosecutor, Pirro shares Martin’s reputation as a political firebrand. As a former U.S. attorney, I know that the job requires a commitment to following the Principles of Federal Prosecution, the DOJ’s policy manual, which forbids the consideration of politics in charging decisions. In fact, federal prosecutors must avoid even the appearance of bias in their work and recuse themselves if their impartiality could be reasonably questioned. In the District of Columbia, where the U.S. attorney’s office might be called upon to handle matters involving members of Congress and federal agencies, confidence in the independence of the U.S. attorney is paramount. Pirro’s history as a strident Trump booster would absolutely and obviously undermine public confidence in the soundness of her discretionary decision-making in the high-profile cases that are likely to come across her desk.

I am reasonably confident that our legal system, with its checks and balances, can prevent Pirro from obtaining convictions against Turmp’s political enemies, but she would have enormous power to make their lives miserable just by initiating investigations. Criminal probes can result in enormous legal fees, harm reputations and create enormous stress for targeted individuals and their family members. As U.S. attorney, Pirro could apply tremendous pressure, even if no charges are ultimately filed.

Unlike federal judges and Cabinet officials, U.S. attorneys rarely endure questioning at a confirmation hearing, instead subjecting themselves to scrutiny by senators outside the public arena. If the Senate takes seriously its work to provide advice and consent in the confirmation process, it will nonetheless demand answers from Pirro in writing and in private before allowing her to use the criminal justice system as a tool of retribution in our nation’s capital."
left,"If you arose Friday morning thinking the U.S. Supreme Court would finally settle the question of birthright citizenship, you were disappointed. We know no more now than we did Thursday about how Chief Justice John Roberts’ court regards children born here: The liberal three-justice minority is certain all are citizens, while the conservative six-person majority remained mum. That conservative majority avoided addressing the constitutionality of President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting birthright citizenship and chose instead to reject so-called “universal injunctions” blocking his executive order.

All we learned Friday is that a final resolution to the question of birthright citizenship is somewhere in the distance.

All we learned Friday is that a final resolution to the question of birthright citizenship is somewhere in the distance, beyond many more rounds of court proceedings.

For families directly targeted by Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order, which aims to bar children born to nonpermanent residents from automatic citizenship, too little has changed. Such families — and especially their yet-to-be born children — remain in the crosshairs of a dispute that will continue unresolved at least for months to come. Going forward, such families will be subjected to harrowing circumstances, not knowing where they stand before the court and the Constitution.

By some accounts, we are five months into this era of uncertainty regarding citizenship. But we have endured years, decades, even centuries of confusion about citizenship.

We know that Trump intended to do away with birthright citizenship seven years ago, even though details were lacking. Consult the Congressional Record, and you’ll discover that the language in Trump’s executive order is similar to the language of bills that have been put forward every session since at least 2003. Scour law review articles and you’ll learn that as far back as the 1980s, some legal scholars have promoted the view that children of noncitizens born in the U.S. cannot be birthright citizens.

This longer view of the dispute over birthright citizenship helps explain why we, in this moment, feel so worn down by the evasion that is Friday’s Supreme Court decision. How long should Americans, especially children born in this country and their families, be expected to endure such indecision, confusion and uncertainty?

Perhaps we should not be surprised to find Roberts’ 21st century court fumbling the birthright citizenship question. Indeed, the origins of birthright citizenship in the United States are in the ignoble ineptitude of lawmakers two centuries ago. In early America, free Black Americans, nonimmigrants, were a despised group, and they were regularly confronted by those who argued that they were not citizens and thus had no rights before the courts or the Constitution.

It was a harrowing existence. In the nation’s early years, the American Colonization Society organized to press free Black Americans to leave the country, to places such as the West African colony of Liberia. The ACS outfitted ships, funded travel and encouraged Black Americans to self-deport, all to preserve the U.S. as a white man’s country. State lawmakers and local officials played their part, enacting so-called Black laws that constrained everyday life — where they worked and worshipped, how they traveled and raised their children — all to further encourage free Black Americans to leave.

Were free Black Americans citizens? They believed so and looked to the terms of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution for authority. All men were created equal, they insisted. The Constitution recognized birthright citizenship and drew no color line, they urged. Today, we can read their ideas in early American newspapers, pamphlets and books. They are to be credited with promoting the terms of their own belonging, and those of all persons born in the United States. Their rallying cry: Citizenship in the U.S. was the result of birth, no more and no less.

Early American lawmakers failed Black Americans, leaving them to make families, lives and communities in the face of profound uncertainty.

Early American lawmakers failed Black Americans, leaving them to make families, lives and communities in the face of profound uncertainty. For example, in 1821, when Congress considered admitting Missouri into the Union, lawmakers asked whether Black Americans would have the right to enter the new state. Only if they were citizens, it was said, and a debate ensued with representatives taking both sides. The result was a twisted injustice: Congress never firmly answer the question and instead admitted Missouri while leaving Black Americans mired in ambiguity.

Also in 1821, U.S. Attorney General William Wirt was asked to resolve whether a free Black man could command a ship in Virginia’s coastal waters. The law provided that he could only if he were a citizen. Thus, Wirt was charged with solving the riddle of Black citizenship. But he did not. Instead, he reached a twisted conclusion: In Virginia, a free Black man could not be a citizen, but in another state he perhaps could. Once again, Black Americans were left to make lives under murky circumstances.

Notoriously, in the 1857 Dred Scott case, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that no Black American could be a citizen. Or at least this is how the story is often told. A closer look reveals that the nation’s high court was deeply divided in that instance. Justice Roger Taney was sure that Black Americans were not birthright citizens. Still, his fellow jurists, Associate Justices Benjamin Curtis and John McLean, took the opposite view. Birthright, they concluded, was the law of the land and, absent a color bar in the Constitution, Black Americans, like their white counterparts, were citizens. The high court failed to settle much at all. Black Americans might be citizens to some, but to others they were subject to Black laws and colonization.

It would take a Civil War and a remaking of the Constitution during Reconstruction to settle debates over Black citizenship. The 14th Amendment constitutionalized the birthright principle that Black Americans had long championed. Along the way, Black Americans learned hard lessons, and so should we. The nation’s founding documents can be subjected to interpretation and reinterpretation in the hands of lawmakers, courts and the executive branch. Those designated as despised can be variously regarded as citizens and noncitizens, while lawmakers fumble and fail to settle the debate.

Those designated as despised can be variously regarded as citizens and noncitizens, while lawmakers fumble and fail to settle the debate

Most of all, by recalling the struggles of Black Americans for birthright citizenship, we better understand that uncertainty before the law is its own form of inhumanity. Being the object of debate is its own sort of harrowing existence. In early America, Black Americans made homes, raised children, established businesses and built a political culture — all the while facing down efforts to banish, exile or otherwise remove them from the nation. We rightly admire their courage and persistence. At the same time, we can recognize the price they paid for being subject to the deliberations of lawmakers who avoided, sidestepped, punted and otherwise refused to settle their status as birthright citizens.

Friday, the nation’s high court fumbled. Rather than affirm the birthright principle, it put that question off for another day. In the months ahead, there will be briefs filed and arguments presented. At the same time, there will also be harrowing days ahead for immigrant Americans and their children, people who urgently await a determination of their standing as birthright citizens before the Constitution.

As a nation, we owe them at least that."

Fairphone says the new device is made with more than 50 percent fair and recycled materials, including cobalt sourced through the Fair Cobalt Alliance, fair gold, silver, and tungsten, and recycled aluminum and rare earth metals. The Fairphone 6 is 100 percent e-waste neutral, made in factories powered by 100 percent renewable energy, by people paid a living wage.

The Fairphone 6 is an Android phone with Google Gemini onboard, but the Fairphone Moments feature enables you to hit a physical switch for a minimalist mode with a pared-back interface and just five apps. Fairphone has always gone for a modular design to make repairs and upgrades easier, but this time, it includes a swappable accessory range with a case, card holder, lanyard, and finger loop. Despite the modular design, the Fairphone 6 has an IP55 rating.

The Fairphone 6 comes with a five-year warranty, software support until 2033 (eight years is more than any other Android manufacturer promises), and a guarantee of seven major Android OS upgrades. Sadly, it’s still not officially sold in the US, but you can buy one for £499 in the UK or 599 Euros on the continent. If you are interested and live in the US, there's a de-Googled version of the Fairphone 6 running e/OS, coming in August. Too bad it costs $899. —Simon Hill

Dell Kills the XPS Brand

XPS is finally dead. Oh, you didn't hear? Dell announced the sweeping rebrand earlier this year, but perhaps its most iconic laptop branding hasn't changed in the past six months. No new XPS models have come out, so the laptop line has been cruising along. But now, Dell's ambitious (and sometimes downright confusing) rebranding efforts have reached XPS, the beloved laptops that have been setting the standard for premium Windows laptops for many years. In place of what would've been the new Dell XPS 14 and XPS 16, the company is launching the Dell Premium 14 and Dell Premium 16. It doesn't roll off the tongue quite the same.

Aside from the name, this is a modest upgrade over last year's models. The new laptops use the latest Intel chips (Core Ultra 200H series) and Nvidia's RTX 50-series graphics. Intel's new chips claim to provide better battery life—up to 27 hours on the Dell Premium 16—whereas the RTX 5050, 5060, and 5070 will improve the graphics. The Dell Premium 14 starts at $1,650, which is $50 cheaper than what it launched at last year.

Meanwhile, the Dell Premium 16 will only launch with the RTX 5070 model, with other configurations to come later. While the designs remain as sleek as ever, the fact that both models start with only a 1920 x 1200-pixel resolution screen feels crazy at that price, especially when stretched out on a 16.3-inch screen. Let's not forget: The 14-inch MacBook Pro has a lower starting price and comes with a high-resolution Mini-LED screen on all models. Prices tend to fluctuate, though, and I'm happy Dell is keeping these creator-based machines with discrete graphics options around. I'll hopefully be testing them soon, but for now, let's pour one out for XPS, an iconic PC brand that's been around since the early 1990s—one of the last holdouts from a wildly different era in technology. —Luke Larsen

Solos' New Smart Glasses Embrace AI

Smart glasses are taking off in various forms, but Solos sees them as wearable AI devices. Both its new models, the AirGo A5 and the AirGo V2, offer access to an AI assistant. The AirGo A5 relies on audio, with built-in speakers and microphones enabling you to access SolosChat to reply to messages or pose queries. You can also use them for calls or to listen to music and podcasts.

The more interesting AirGo V2 packs a 16-megapixel camera and a more advanced version 3.0 of SolosChat that combines ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek to identify objects, translate text, and provide the answers you need. Like the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, you can also use them to snap photos and shoot videos hands-free."
left,"Last week, The Washington Post reported that many Senate Democrats were concerned that Donald Trump was “considering striking Iran without seeking authorization from Congress — or even filling them in on his plans.” Those fears were well grounded: Two days later, the president ordered preemptive airstrikes against Iranian targets, without congressional authorization and without informing key Democratic officials.

Ahead of the offensive, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia introduced a war powers resolution designed to limit the use of the U.S. armed forces against Iran without congressional approval.

Six days after the airstrikes, the Senate took up the measure — privileged resolutions reach the floor, whether the majority’s leadership likes it or not — and it was not subject to the 60-vote filibuster rule. In other words, all Kaine’s proposal needed was a simple majority.

He didn’t get one.

The 53-47 vote opposing the resolution fell mostly on party lines — with Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., as the only senators to break with their own sides.

At this point, the effort might appear moot. After all, the strikes already happened, and the White House has already effectively declared “mission accomplished.”

But it’s not quite that simple. After Trump administration officials provided a closed-door briefing to the entire Senate on the Iran strikes — a presentation that did not resolve the underlying political debate — Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer quickly turned his attention to the debate over Kaine’s proposal.

“Anybody who sat in that [briefing] and is honest with themselves would recognize that we need to enforce the War Powers Act and force the administration to provide answers to some very important questions about Iran and our national security,” the New York Democrat said. “When the administration is forced to answer questions, we’ll get more clarity, and maybe they’ll get more clarity, too. So it’s an important thing to do.”

What’s more, despite the recent chatter about Saturday’s mission being a “one-and-done” operation, the president himself continues to make clear that he’s prepared to launch additional strikes as he — and he alone — sees fit.

Ahead of the vote, The New Republic’s Greg Sargent argued that if the Senate rejected the resolution, it would “only embolden Trump at a time when he is clearly growing more unhinged, power-crazed, and deaf to outside voices.” Hours later, senators missed an opportunity to apply some checks and balances on a White House that needs to be checked and balanced."
left,"The wedding week of ubiquitous multibillionaire Jeff Bezos and former television journalist Lauren Sánchez’s has unfolded in a frenzy of paparazzi photos, outrage and protest, whispers of wealthy wedding guests — and, sadly, an uninspiring aesthetic.

What might have been an opportunity to win a highly skeptical public has, predictably, become an exercise in tone-deaf excess. It doesn’t even feel particularly fun to write about — and trust me, I love weddings and bridal fashion.

What might have been an opportunity to win a highly skeptical public has, predictably, become an exercise in tone-deaf excess.

Bezos and Sánchez reportedly began their relationship in 2019. Both had announced divorces that same year; Bezos from MacKenzie Scott, with whom he shares four children, and Sánchez from her second husband, Patrick Whitesell, with whom she shares two children. Their first year together was filled with tabloid controversy. In a Medium post, Bezos accused the National Enquirer of blackmailing him with private, suggestive photos that he had sent to Sánchez. The crux of the public intrigue wasn’t the blackmail, but Bezos’ very visible wedding band in the photographs.

Bezos proposed to Sánchez in 2023 with a light pink cushion cut diamond, estimated to be worth anywhere from $3 to $5 million. The proposal took place aboard Bezos’ $500 million yacht during the Cannes Film Festival. In the years since, their relationship has been defined by heavily photographed outings, both personal and professional, ostentatious events and public displays of affection. Those close to the couple are quick to say their love is “demonstrable.”

Many details of the wedding have remained secret. We do know it took place Friday. We know it is expected to cost between $45 and $55 million and that upward of 90 private jets were expected to land at Venice’s Treviso and Verona airports. We know that five of Venice’s most upscale hotels were reportedly booked to host some 200 guests. We know, after ABC News obtained a bizarrely designed portion of their wedding invitation, that the couple requested donations to three Venetian institutions in lieu of gifts — which feels, to me, like table stakes.

The festivities began earlier this week with a foam party on the deck of Bezos’ yacht, per images of Bezos and Sánchez, both in bathing suits and covered in soapy white foam, circulating online. The photos reignited popular social media speculation and trolling that, for Bezos, this is all an opportunity to be a “cool guy.” That foam party seemed to set the tone for the rest of the week: an uncanny display of wealth, out of step with what we have come to expect from high-profile weddings.

The celebrations were met with protests across Venice. On Monday, a group of protesters took over Piazza San Marco with banners that read “If You Can Rent Venice For Your Wedding You Can Pay More Tax” and “No Space for Bezos.” According to CNN, one organizer spoke to the crowd and said, “Let’s make sure that Venice is not remembered as a postcard venue where Bezos had his wedding but as the city that did not bend to oligarchs.”

From Venice to New York City, the world is growing weary of the extraordinary wealth divide between the uber wealthy, the “oligarchy,” and the rest of us. And it isn’t just that Bezos is some sort of representative figurehead; he’s supported Trump and Trump-era policies that will impact every one of us financially, socially or politically. There is a dissonance here that cannot be ignored.

Sánchez wore a Dolce & Gabbana wedding gown for the ceremony. According to Puck, her decision to wear the Italian fashion house was simple: “She likes it, those guys are nice to her, and [Vogue’s Anna] Wintour approves.” Sánchez, who went viral for wearing a tailored Alexander McQueen pantsuit and exposed lacy bra to President Donald Trump’s second inauguration, has leaned into clothing with sex appeal. Her lace wedding gown, reportedly inspired by Sophia Loren’s gown in the 1958 film “Houseboat” is unsurprising.

This wedding — the tenor, the clothes, the cost — indicate a callous indifference toward the realities the rest of the world is facing. Perhaps part of what makes it so unsettling is the indisputable knowledge of how much good Bezos, Sánchez and their wedding guests could be doing to help the world. A few million dollars in donations, when you have a few billion dollars, is not amelioration. Not even close.

When everyone knows how much you have, flaunting it so flagrantly is insulting to the common person — even vulgar. People are struggling — emotionally, financially and socially. We are in the midst geopolitical crisis, the U.S. economy is flashing warning signs, young people cannot afford homes, and the country is split political and socially. Let them eat wedding cake, I guess."

The Best Deals on Hiking Apparel

Be sure to check out our guides to the best rain jackets, the best merino wool, and how to layer your clothes to stay comfy in any weather.

This deal is only on one color (Redtail Rust for men's and Oxide Red for the women's), and probably won't last, but this is the lowest price we've seen for one of our favorite hiking rain jackets.

This North Face fleece jacket features in our upcoming guide to mid layers. The stretchy, recycled midweight fleece is perfect for cool mornings and evenings in the shoulder seasons. It offers a good range of motion, though the sleeves are elastic, which some people will not like. I like this fleece, though, because it's not overly technical looking, you can wear it around town or when belaying.

The Rab Cinder Phantom is our favorite rain jacket for cycling. It solves almost all my issues with rain gear—it's incredibly light (3.3 ounces/114 grams for a medium), stuffs down to about the size of a tennis ball, and is somehow surprisingly waterproof. It will eventually wet out, but it takes quite a downpour.

When the weather gets down well below freezing, and the wind makes your cheeks burn, this is the jacket I turn to. With a base layer at the bottom, a wool sweater over that, then this jacket, I was toasty warm walking in the early morning chill of winter (usually -10 Fahrenheit in January). The shell is lightweight (20D) Pertex ripstop nylon that's nicely windproof and water-resistant. For some reason, only the women's jacket is on sale.

If you live in a cold climate, even if it's not quite Canada, you need this shirt. It's your classic, ultrawarm wool shirt. Sorry, shirt jacket. Whatever it is, it's warm, cozy, and comfy. Don't let the wool scare you, it's not itchy.

I bought this during the REI Anniversary sale in May and have been very happy with it. It's too hot for it now, but a cool spring gave me a chance to wear it for a good week. It's slightly oversized, but very soft, stretchy and comfortable. I mean it's a merino wool beanie, hard to go wrong with one of those. And it's Fjällräven so it's well-made and should last a very long time.

Huckberry's Proof 72-hour Merino T-shirt will rank very high in our upcoming guide to merino T-shirts. It's soft, and the classic fit is loose and comfortable. It doesn't look overly “sporty,” the way many merino T-shirts do (though there is a slim fit version also on sale for $52 ($20 off) if you prefer that style). This shirt is 87 percent merino wool and 13 percent nylon, which gives it a bit of extra stretch.

The best midweight base layer we've tested, this Smartwool shirt is perfect for chilly spring and fall mornings. It's comfortable, though tending to be looser fitting, which is something to keep in mind when layering. The heavy-duty seams (read: sturdier, longer lasting) don't rub, and sit off the shoulder for more comfort when wearing a pack. At 87 percent merino wool (blended with nylon), these are also very durable while remaining lightweight (10.3 oz for a men's large).

I bought my father, father-in-law, brother-in-law, and husband each one of these shirts last year. Roark Clothing is a small company that makes some of my favorite active apparel, and the Bless Up shirt is the perfect summer shirt. It's perforated and made from synthetic fibers, so it's perfect for super-humid beach days when the temperatures are above 90 degrees. —Adrienne So

This is another deal that's only on one color, but REI 650 puffy jacket (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best budget 3-season puffy you can buy, more so at this price. At 10.9 ounces it's reasonably lightweight and has large hand pockets and some very nice internal pockets for stashing a hat or gloves.

Deals on Backpacking Gear

This deal is a combo of our top pick backpacking water filter and our top pick water bladder. As the name suggests, the Sawyer is a squeeze filter, but paired with the Cnoc it turns into a gravity filter when you have the time. When I'm not testing something else, this is the filtration system I use and it's never let me down. If you don't want the Cnoc bladder for some reason the Sawyer is also on sale for $35 ($10 off).

Heading into bear country this summer? You'll very likely need a bear-resistant way to store your food. In my experience, the BV500 from Bear Vault is the most widely approved option (though always check with the rangers in the area). At 700 cubic inches, the BV500 has room for about 3-5 days of food for two (depending on how well you pack). It does weigh almost 3 pounds, and it's a bummer to carry, but when you need it, you need it—might as well grab one when it's a little cheaper.

I'm not sure this really qualifies for the “ultralight” moniker, and these pots are unfortunately marred by having a ton of fake influencer reviews out there, but they're actually quite good. The hard-anodized aluminum is sturdy and provides good heat transfer. The ceramic nonstick coating makes for easy cleanup (especially paired with the GSI scraper below).

Still the most useful piece of backpacking gear I own, GSI's pot scraper is the unsung hero of backcountry cooking, turning cleanup from a tedious chore to a couple of seconds’ work. Now, if you seriously burn something, this thing will not save you (boil water in the pan to loosen the burnt bits), but for every other situation, scraping down your pot with this tool will get you 99 percent of the way to a clean pot.

This has been my backpack of choice for the last five years. It's light, durable (it's made of Dyneema), and carries loads of up to about 35 pounds in comfort. The rear mesh pocket gives you a place to stash wet gear, and water-repellent outer means your gear doesn't get wet (there may be limits to this, but I've never had a problem). My only regret is that I didn't get the 55 liters (also on sale for $340 ($60 off)), so I could fit a little more gear when backpacking with my kids.

While I love my Junction pack (see above), were I buying today, I would get the Southwest. The only real difference is the outer rear pocket, which is mesh in the Junction and Dyneema in the Southwest. Turns out I never dry wet gear in the mesh, and I have found it snags on things more than I'd like. If you don't need the mesh, the Southwest is the pack to get. Again, I'd go 55 liters, but if I were only doing solo trips, the 40 liters should be plenty.

Sea to Summit's ultralight Alto (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is designed to keep weight down on your solo adventures. At just 33 ounces for a semi-freestanding tent, it remains one of the lighter options on the market, and at this price it's hard to pass up.

Photograph: Scott Gilbertson

Six Moon Design's Lunar Solo (7/10, WIRED Review) is my favorite single-wall ultralight solo tent. It's not without its quirks (read the pitching tips), but if you want something more than a tarp, that still weighs just 26 ounces (740 grams), this one is hard to beat.

The Zenbivy Bed 25 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is hands-down the most comfortable backcountry sleeping experience I've ever had. It wouldn't be my top pick for extreme situations, but so long as your expected temperatures fit in Zenbivy's range (the comfort rating is 35 degrees Fahrenheit), it doesn't get more comfortable than this. The Zenbivy isn't just a sleeping bag. It's a sheet, hood, and quilt-style bag that can be combined in various ways.

Zenbivy's Light Bed is a brand-new option that takes the basic clip design of other Zenbivy beds and lightens up the load. I've been testing this bag for several months, and it is everything I loved about the original above, but lighter weight. I'll have a full review very soon, but if you've been tempted by the Zenbivy, but wanted to keep your base gear weight down, this is the option you've been looking for.

It's no longer our top pick for side sleepers, but the Questar remains a good option for those who want more room. It uses what Therm-a-Rest calls W.A.R.M. fit, which stands for “with additional room for multiple” positions. Indeed, this bag is very roomy for a mummy design. I was able to draw my legs up when side-sleeping and spread out considerably more than with most of the other sleeping bags I've tested.

Photograph: REI

Sea to Summit’s Ether Light XT is only marginally heavier than the Therm-a-Rest above. The extra 4 ounces for the Sea to Summit pad gets you quite a bit more cushion too—this is a 4-inch thick pad, compared to the 3 inches of the Therm-a-rest X-Lite, which makes this a better ultralight option for side sleepers. I also like the baffle design better, and it seems to be a little more durable, making this an excellent alternative ultralight pad. Note that this one is an REI Outlet deal; the XT has been replaced by a newer model.

Hiking and Camping Deals

Don't forget to check out our guide to the Best Day-Hiking Backpacks and the Best Travel Bags.

This chair is the coziest way to hang out around camp. It is somewhat huge, heavy, and awkward to fold up and carry, but so long as you have room for it in your vehicle, there's no better way to relax around the fire with your loved ones.

This deal is only available on the almost blinding Firefly Yellow color, but if that works for you, this is the best price we've ever seen on the Roadie 32. The Roadie coolers aren't quite as robust as the Yeti Tundra, but they're great for camping. You get a basket for organizing your contents and the usual high-quality Yeti rotomolding to keep your food cold for up to five days in our testing. Hurry, though, this deal will not last.

Osprey has been making Talon packs since 2007. This model is the smaller cousin to the 33L version in our guide to the best day-hiking packs. The success of the Talon line is well deserved, the 100-denier high-tenacity nylon (Bluesign-approved) makes for a durable pack while remaining reasonably lightweight (2 pounds, 1 ounce for the S/M size). The dual zippered panel-loading design makes getting to your stuff a snap, and there are plenty of extra pockets inside and outside to help you stash all your gear.

I have yet to do a trip with a satellite communicator, but I do understand why people use them. If I were to bring one along, this is the one I'd get. It's tiny, light (3.5 ounces), and easily stashable. It utilizes the super-fast Iridium satellite network, so you can send a rapid SOS from pretty much anywhere. There are extra features like waypoints and interval tracking, and it plays nice with compatible Garmin watches.

Oru's foldable kayaks are genius—all the boat, none of the size. The Lake is light, reasonably fast, and the cheapest way to get into the world of folding kayaks. As with all Oru's offerings, the Lake folds origami-style into a roughly 30-inch square that’s just 15 inches deep—small enough to fit in a car trunk or hall closet.

Our favorite way to avoid the green propane bottles is this gas growler. This model gets you a 1.2-pound propane tank with a nice padded/insulated sleeve and a handy strap for carrying, and it makes your camp setup look much nicer than a bare tank. It also saves your shins during those inevitable run-ins with cold hard steel that come from lugging around a big propane tank. This size is the equivalent of five green propane bottles."
left,"Birthright citizenship suffered a setback on Friday, but the judiciary was dealt an even heavier blow.

Giving President Donald Trump a huge victory in his ongoing quest to amass executive power, the Supreme Court decided, 6-3, that federal district courts lack the power to issue nationwide injunctions. The justices remanded to lower courts the cases that had challenged Trump’s birthright citizenship executive order, but said that those courts’ decisions will apply only to the plaintiffs in each specific cases.

Since the case of Marbury v. Madison, courts have had the power to say what the law is. Today, the Supreme Court has shrunk from this role at the risk of enabling what Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson calls a ""zone of lawlessness, within which the Executive has the prerogative to take or leave the law as it wishes, and where individuals who would otherwise be entitled to the law’s protection become subject to the Executive’s whims instead.""

Since the case of Marbury v. Madison, courts have had the power to say what the law is.

On the first day of his second term in office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order redefining citizenship to exclude children born in the United States to parents who lack legal immigration status. This is contrary to legal scholars’ traditional understanding of the 14th Amendment and breaks over a century of precedent. In response, individual plaintiffs, advocacy groups and several states quickly filed lawsuits in Maryland, Washington and Massachusetts. Federal courts found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and enjoined the administration from executing the executive order. These injunctions applied broadly to anyone whose citizenship was affected, on the ground that without relief, they would all suffer irreparable harm. Appeals courts affirmed the lower courts.

The Trump administration sought immediate relief from the Supreme Court, requesting a stay of the injunctions. The question before the court was procedural: Trump’s solicitor general had argued that the injunctions should be limited to the individual parties who brought the suits rather than applied to anyone in the United States to whom the new definition applied. In other words, Trump’s White House was using this case to fight an adjacent battle against the use of injunctions more broadly, with big implications beyond citizenship.

Nationwide or “universal” injunctions permit lone judges in single districts to block presidential initiatives from taking effect, and they have been criticized by members of both political parties. During Trump’s first term, when a district court in Hawaii blocked his travel ban targeting mostly Muslim countries, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, “I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and constitutional power.”

During the Biden administration, a nationwide injunction overruling the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion medication mifepristone drew similar criticism. Even a federal judge in Kansas who issued a nationwide injunction to halt Biden’s student loan forgiveness program expressed his reluctance to do so, writing, “Nationwide injunctions are the subject of much controversy, and this court is less than enthusiastic about entering one.”

One of the problems with nationwide injunctions is that the plaintiffs in such cases sometimes engage in “forum shopping,” or filing lawsuits in districts where they are likely to draw judges sympathetic to their causes. For example, the lawsuit in the mifepristone case was filed in Amarillo, Texas, a judicial division where the sole judge was a well-known opponent of abortion.

But without nationwide application, injunctions would block federal policies in some parts of the country and not others, leading to a chaotic, difficult-to-administer hodgepodge of federal law. Changes to the procedures for issuing nationwide injunctions may be preferable as a policy decision, but the court rejected the Trump administration’s argument as a legal matter.

And in this case, the procedural question is inextricably intertwined with the substantive issue. The Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment provides that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” Trump’s January executive order defines “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” to exclude children born to undocumented parents, despite Supreme Court precedent to the contrary. In 1898, the Supreme Court stated in the case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark that the 14th Amendment “affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and under the protection of the country, including all children born here of resident aliens.” To date, every court to address the issue has ruled against the Trump administration’s definition.

To date, every court to address the issue has ruled against the Trump administration’s definition.

During oral argument, justices from both sides of the political spectrum questioned the practicality of the administration’s position, which would lead to a patchwork of different laws applying different parts of the country, but today, the court’s conservative majority went big for Trump, eroding the power of the judiciary to serve as a check on the exercise of executive power. As Jackson noted in her dissent, our country will now consist of zone one, where individuals born in the country are granted birthright citizenship, and zone two, where they are non-citizens subject to deportation — at least until the court settles the constitutionality of Trump’s order.

Justice Elena Kagan had pressed the solicitor general about what would happen to all the babies born while legal challenges are pending. Without a universal injunction, she noted, an “untold number of people” currently entitled to U.S. citizenship would be without lawful status to remain in the country. Justice Sonia Sotomayor went so far as to call these newborns “stateless.” As Jackson had noted, the absence of a nationwide injunction would require every individual affected by the executive order to file their own lawsuit, turning the government’s immigration enforcement into a “catch-me-if-you-can kind of regime.”

Even the conservative justices had seemed skeptical. Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted the uncertainty that would befall hospitals and states in the interim. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, too, expressed doubts. But today, Coney Barrett wrote the opinion that will give Trump the green light to issue more executive orders with aggressive arguments to extend his powers.

Several ideas had previously been put forward to limit the use of nationwide injunctions, such as requiring a three-judge panel in cases in which a plaintiff seeks a nationwide injunction, raising the burden of proof or requiring cases challenging the legality of a president’s executive order with nationwide application to be filed in the District of Columbia to preclude forum shopping. Now that nationwide injunctions have been killed, Congress could step in to resuscitate them, but it seems doubtful that the current GOP-controlled legislature has the appetite to check the president’s power.

For now, the substantive issue of birthright citizenship remains on hold while the cases challenging Trump’s executive order work their way through the legal system until they too inevitably land at the Supreme Court. But until then, babies born in the United States are at risk of the fate Sotomayor feared — statelessness."
left,"Welcome back, Deadline: Legal Newsletter readers. The final opinions handed down each Supreme Court term provide a chance for reflection on where the court is at and where it’s going. A stark view of the Roberts Court comes from within the court itself, where dissenting justices hold up a mirror to the majority’s power. One word used in dissents that bookended the week stood out: ""lawless.""

Justice Sonia Sotomayor started the week by calling out the Republican-appointed majority for “rewarding lawlessness.” Joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson on Monday, Sotomayor lamented the court’s unexplained shadow-docket decision to ignore the Trump administration’s defiance while approving its quest to speed up deportations without due process.

Then in Friday’s birthright citizenship case, Sotomayor’s dissent for the Democratic appointees exposed the majority’s latest farce. In a decision by Trump appointee Amy Coney Barrett, the court granted the government’s bid to curb nationwide injunctions, which trial judges had issued against President Donald Trump’s birthright citizenship order (because it’s “blatantly unconstitutional,” as a Reagan-appointed judge put it). Notably, the administration didn’t ask the justices to approve the legality of Trump’s order or even to fully unblock the injunctions.

Why not seek more aggressive relief from a sympathetic court? “The answer is obvious,” Sotomayor wrote Friday. “To get such relief, the Government would have to show that the Order is likely constitutional, an impossible task in light of the Constitution’s text, history, this Court’s precedents, federal law, and Executive Branch practice,” the Obama appointee wrote.

So, the administration took a procedural half-measure that deliberately avoided resolving the underlying issue — and the majority was happy to oblige. Litigation will now continue in the lower courts, with needless uncertainty looming over when and how the justices will finally rule on Trump’s bid to upend the constitutional guarantee of automatic citizenship for people born on U.S. soil.

With Barrett and company approving that “gamesmanship,” as Sotomayor called it, Sotomayor observed that the majority invited open defiance of the Constitution. “Until the day that every affected person manages to become party to a lawsuit and secures for himself injunctive relief, the Government may act lawlessly indefinitely,” she wrote.

Justice Jackson furthered the ‘lawless’ theme in her own dissent. Writing for herself, the Biden appointee critiqued the court’s “creation of a zone of lawlessness,” one that she said “will disproportionately impact the poor, the uneducated, and the unpopular — i.e., those who may not have the wherewithal to lawyer up, and will all too often find themselves beholden to the Executive’s whims.”

Hi Ruth,

I view this through a slightly different lens, although I reach a similar conclusion about the status quo.

While there have been moments where the court has spoken strongly with one voice — Brown v. Board of Education is an oft-cited example — tensions have always existed within the court. That’s unsurprising in any powerful group, certainly in one as powerful as the Supreme Court.

But I don’t think there was a previous magical time when the court was impartial and then it just stopped being that way.

Yet, there used to be more of an equilibrium on the court maintained by members who’ve been described as “swing justices.” Take a relatively recent example of Justice Anthony Kennedy (Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s predecessor), who went both ways over the years in cases that could be described as more conservative-friendly outcomes in some appeals and more liberal-friendly outcomes in others.

Whether justices used to be more honorable, I’m not sure. But we do know that Trump appointee Amy Coney Barrett, who replaced Clinton appointee Ruth Bader Ginsburg, bolstered a generational shift that gave Republicans a supermajority on the court. That Barrett could be described today as a swing justice — or perhaps more accurately, a median justice — in some cases shows how far to the right the court has gone, lending itself to the circus-like atmosphere you describe.

left,"A small clause inside OpenAI’s contract with Microsoft, once considered a distant hypothetical, has now become a flashpoint in one of the biggest partnerships in tech.

The clause states that if OpenAI’s board ever declares it has developed artificial general intelligence (AGI), it would limit Microsoft’s contracted access to the startup’s future technologies. Microsoft, which has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI, is now reportedly pushing for the removal of the clause and is considering walking away from the deal entirely, according to the Financial Times.

Late last year, tensions around AGI’s suddenly pivotal role in the Microsoft deal spilled into a debate within OpenAI over an internal research paper, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Titled “Five Levels of General AI Capabilities,” the paper outlines a framework for classifying progressive stages of AI technology. By making specific assertions about future AI capabilities, sources claim, the paper could have complicated OpenAI’s ability to declare that it had achieved AGI, a potential point of leverage in negotiations.

“We’re focused on developing empirical methods to evaluate AGI progress—work that is reproducible, measurable, and useful to the broader field,” OpenAI spokesperson Lindsay McCallum said in a written comment to WIRED. “The ‘Five Levels’ was an early attempt at classifying stages and terminology to describe general AI capabilities. This was not a scientific research paper.” Microsoft declined to comment.

In a blog post describing its corporate structure, OpenAI notes that AGI “is excluded from IP licenses and other commercial terms with Microsoft.” OpenAI defines AGI as ""a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.”

The two companies have been renegotiating their agreement as OpenAI prepares a corporate restructuring. While Microsoft wants continued access to OpenAI’s models even if the startup declares AGI before the partnership ends in 2030, one person familiar with the partnership discussions tells WIRED that Microsoft doesn’t believe OpenAI will reach AGI by that deadline. But another source close to the matter describes the clause as OpenAI’s ultimate leverage. Both sources have been granted anonymity to speak freely about private discussions.

According to the Wall Street Journal, OpenAI has even considered whether to invoke the clause based on an AI coding agent. The talks have grown so fraught that OpenAI has reportedly discussed if it should publicly accuse Microsoft of anticompetitive behavior, per the Journal.

A source familiar with the discussions, granted anonymity to speak freely about the negotiations, says OpenAI is fairly close to achieving AGI; Altman has said he expects to see it during Donald Trump’s current term.

That same source suggests there are two relevant definitions: First, OpenAI’s board can unilaterally decide the company has reached AGI as defined in its charter, which would immediately cut Microsoft off from accessing the technology or revenue derived from AGI; Microsoft would still have rights to everything before that milestone. Second, the contract includes a concept of sufficient AGI, added in 2023, which defines AGI as a system capable of generating a certain level of profit. If OpenAI asserts it has reached that benchmark, Microsoft must approve the determination. The contract also bars Microsoft from pursuing AGI on its own or through third parties using OpenAI’s IP."
left,"Two weeks ago, as Israeli warplanes pounded targets in Tehran and Iranian missiles screamed back in retaliation, Washington scrambled to revive a tool President Donald Trump had recklessly destroyed via executive order three months earlier: Voice of America’s Persian Service.

On March 15, Trump had ordered the United States Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America and was established to push back against censorship and disinformation worldwide, to shut down VOA’s programming in all 49 of its broadcast languages, including Persian. Thus, Trump crippled a key pillar of U.S. soft power.

As soon as the missiles began flying and Washington realized it had no way to reach the Iranian public, it made a cynical about-face.

But as soon as the missiles began flying and Washington realized it had no way to reach the Iranian public, it made a cynical about-face. On June 13, the day Israel launched its attack on Iran, VOA Persian journalists — who'd been left on administrative leave for months with no clarity about their future — were abruptly called back. One journalist told me they were lured back with vague suggestions that cooperating might look favorable during an upcoming restructuring.

On June 20, Kari Lake, Trump’s USAGM adviser, laid off most of the Persian journalists anyway, including my source, and 639 others across VOA. This wasn’t mismanagement; it was sabotage — of staff morale, institutional integrity and America’s global credibility.

The next day, VOA Persian Service attempted to livestream Trump’s remarks on Iran but couldn’t. As Patsy Widakuswara, VOA’s White House correspondent and a lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against the Trump administration, explained in a social media post: the audio failed within seconds, and the full video of Trump’s remarks wasn’t uploaded for hours.

But by then the damage was done. Tehran’s state media had flooded the information space and shaped the narrative without challenge.

Wednesday, for the first time in four years, a source told me, the VOA Persian team didn’t broadcast Trump’s NATO speech live. That’s a glaring sign of just how badly Trump and Lake have deteriorated the operation.

During my 20 years inside USAGM newsrooms — most notably at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), VOA’s sister agency — I worked alongside the fearless journalists of its Persian-language service, Radio Farda, who pushed back against the Iranian regime’s censorship day in and day out.

During the 2009 post-election protests — widely known as the Green Wave or Persian Spring — Radio Farda amplified the voices of a nation in defiance by reporting on hunger strikers, protesters marching straight into gunfire, students standing their ground against armed forces and families demanding justice for their murdered loved ones.

Before the war began, more than 6.6 million Iranians accessed Farda each week to get news that was not produced by Iran's state-controlled propaganda networks.

No other outlet had the access, the credibility or the reach. With trusted sources on the ground, we didn’t report from a safe distance; we stood with the Iranian people, armed with facts, grounded in courage and committed to truth.

A journalist I reached out to for this column told me, “VOA Persian journalists who have family members living in Iran have always faced pressure through their relatives from Iranian authorities. After the Israeli and U.S. bombing raids on Iran, the relatives of several Persian-language journalists have been threatened again. This is important because not only have we lost our jobs, but we are also under renewed pressure from the Iranian regime.”

During this month’s Israel-Iran conflict, even with its resources gutted, Radio Farda’s Instagram profile attracted 62.5 million video views, a spike of 344%, and traffic to its website rose by 77% compared to its 30-day average.

Even before the war began, more than 6.6 million Iranians, 10% of the adult population, accessed Farda each week to get news that was not produced by Iran's state-controlled propaganda networks. In a media environment dominated by fear, censorship and digital barriers, that level of trust and reach isn’t just remarkable — it’s irreplaceable.

Even so, Lake is tearing it all down.

And VOA Persian, what was once a full-day broadcast lifeline for Iranians, is now down to 30, maybe 45, minutes a day. And Lake, a former broadcast journalist herself, had the gall to celebrate such destruction as “efficiency” when she testified to Congress on Wednesday. Lake even pointed to a dubious note — allegedly from someone who remains on staff — suggesting that getting rid of 75% of VOA Persian Service’s staff had made things run better.

No credible journalist would say that. And no credible journalist would believe that.

Despite her suggestion that the slashed staff is more efficient, during Wednesday’s House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Lake called for USAGM to be abolished entirely, its editorial firewall shredded, its remnants folded into the State Department and its journalists replaced with freelancers who’d produce patriotic puff pieces about America’s founding fathers, civil liberties and “what this country is about.” That’s not journalism; that’s state-sponsored propaganda at its laziest and in its most unserious form.

“I feel like I am suffering through a propaganda war through your testimony,” Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., told Lake during Wednesday’s congressional hearing. “For those of you who think this is about reform — it’s not. It’s about shutting down media.”

Lake’s plans reveal her dangerous ignorance (or disregard) of history. VOA broadcasts were never meant to glorify the USA. but to to confront lies and support democracy. From exposing Nazi propaganda in World War II, pushing back against Soviet disinformation during the Cold War and challenging Tehran’s theocratic censorship, USAGM’s mission has always been clear: deliver the truth where it’s forbidden to exist.

Iranians who once tuned into VOA Persian now have nowhere else to go but the state-owned disinformation networks. America has willingly shut off its microphone as its adversaries are broadcasting loud and clear."
left,"Persona games are herculean efforts to finish. A single playthrough of any game in the main series, which includes everything from saving the world to studying for finals, frequently clocks in at around 100 hours. Much of that time is spent building relationships with the game’s characters and world by hanging out with friends, doing mundane tasks like laundry, or finding new parts of the city to explore. It creates a dedication that leaves many players so attached to each game’s cast that they’ll eagerly jump into new experiences just to get more time with them.

Persona 5 was no exception. Since its launch in 2016, the JRPG has inspired spin-offs across a variety of genres, from rhythm game Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight to the strategy-based Persona 5 Tactica. On June 26, codevelopers Atlus, Sega, and Perfect World released Persona 5: The Phantom X—a spin-off for PC and mobile that mirrors the original game so closely, it works as both an easy introduction to the series, and an enjoyable re-entry into Persona 5’s world.

Much like with Persona 5, Phantom X s follows a group of teenage vigilantes known as Phantom Thieves who gain the power to summon powerful entities, Personas, to fight evil forces. More directly, the game feels like Persona 5, adopting its turn-based battle system, music, visual style, social links, and more to deliver an experience on PC and mobile devices that works surprisingly well for a series with so much to do.

While The Phantom X opens almost identically to the original game, it quickly veers away from Persona 5’s cast to establish its own. Something is off in the world of high school student Nagisa Kamishiro, where people are losing the desires that guide their free will and dreams. In order to help people reclaim their lives, Nagisa and his friends will need to crawl through the Metaverse, a foe-filled alternate reality only they can enter, and fight back.

The Phantom X is free-to-play, but is a gacha game, meaning it has in-game purchases and relies on randomized pulls for things like characters from other games in the series and items. It’s a controversial style that can prompt players to fork over cash endlessly to get the experience they want. Because of that system, The Phantom X is best played at a daily pace, rather than long stretches. The game has daily activities and awards to earn, and developers plan to continue releasing content for it over the coming months. Right now, the game only features Japanese voice acting and English subtitles, which may be a deterrent for some fans.

Although the Persona series is available on handheld consoles, like the PS Vita or Nintendo Switch, The Phantom X is the first time the more traditional JRPG version is available on mobile. The game uses touch controls to move through its world and select commands. Its cutscenes work well even on a small screen, and though its menu can feel at times cramped (depending on your screen size) it’s an experience that flows seamlessly. Mobile platforms are well-suited to the dungeon crawling aspects of the game especially, allowing for much needed breaks and the ability to quickly jump back in at any time.

For players who want to relive the highlights of the Persona 5 universe, The Phantom X is an easy recommendation. Its faithful recreation of the original game’s best elements, mixed with a new story, makes the experience feel like a premium one—and a promising look at what a Persona game could look like on your phone."
left,"Ten years after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, Jen Psaki reflected on her experience working inside the White House when that historic order came down and explained why she considers it one of her favorite days from her career in government.

Psaki, who at the time was serving as President Barack Obama's White House communications director, described the weeks leading up to the Supreme Court’s decision as “incredibly special.”

“And part of the reason it was is because there was a young guy at the time named Jeff Tiller, who worked on the communications team, and he had this idea about lighting the White House in rainbow colors if the Supreme Court decided the right way,” Psaki said. “We didn’t know what they were going to do, but we obviously wanted to prepare for a range of scenarios.”

Psaki explained that Tiller was told to prepare a memo about his idea for the president and first lady Michelle Obama. After the Obamas approved, all the White House had to wait for was the final word from the justices.

“And then, of course, when the Supreme Court voted the right way, there are now these incredibly iconic photos [of] couples celebrating outside of the White House,” said Psaki, who described that day — June 26, 2015 — as “one of my favorite days of working in government, of all of my days of working in government.”

Psaki said the story serves as proof that “ideas can come from all sorts of places,” which she argued was an especially important message in the nation’s current political climate: “And in this moment where we’re trying to fight for what’s right, and so many people are out there not sure if they should raise their hand, if they should put their ideas forward, if they should put themselves out there, that absolutely you should. Because sometimes your idea is going to be the one that maybe does a version of lighting the White House in rainbow colors.”

left,"Dan Drezner, a political scientist at Tufts University, recently wrote that the Trump administration “is trying to kill American higher education,” and while that phrasing might’ve seemed hyperbolic, there are ample data points to bolster the thesis.

Over the course of the president’s second term, Donald Trump and his team have waged a multifaceted campaign to bring universities to heel, cutting off grants, targeting tax exemptions, proposing tax increases on university endowments, taking steps to block international students, targeting schools’ accreditation and seeking unprecedented control over how prominent academic institutions function.

Alas, that’s not all they’re doing. The New York Times reported:

The University of Virginia’s president, James E. Ryan, has told the board overseeing the school that he will resign in the face of demands by the Trump administration that he step aside to help resolve a Justice Department inquiry into the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, according to three people briefed on the matter.

The developments have been confirmed by NBC News, The Washington Post and The Daily Progress in Charlottesville, where the university is located.

The trouble apparently began when the Justice Department opened an investigation into the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, which was itself a radical move. As the process unfolded and Trump’s DOJ concluded that the University of Virginia hadn’t gone far enough to destroy its DEI programs, the school’s oversight board — the members of which were appointed by the commonwealth’s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin — reportedly reached out to administration officials, asking what could be done to avoid Trump-imposed punishments.

According to a separate New York Times report, the Justice Department replied that the administration would back off if the university’s president resigned.

“Time is running short, and the department’s patience is wearing thin,” one recent letter from a DOJ official told the oversight board.

This was, the Times added, “the first time the administration has pushed a university to remove its leader.”

If the reporting is accurate, the circumstances are rather bonkers. The Republican administration launched an unnecessary investigation into a prominent university and concluded that the school cared too much about having a diverse student body. It was at that point that the institution was forced to confront extortion-like tactics: Oust the university president, or face the kind of consequences the White House has already imposed on other schools that refused to appease Trump’s demands.

Note: The president doesn’t have the legal authority to fire a university president on his own, but by embracing these heavy-handed tactics, he doesn’t need the authority; Trump and his confederates can simply force the issue by way of credible threats.

When making a list of the president and his team embracing an authoritarian-style tactics, be sure to include “trying to dictate how universities operate” to the growing list."
left,"Before June 8, the skilled and respected ABC News television journalist Terry Moran was neither a household name nor political lightning rod. That changed abruptly when Moran posted on X that Donald Trump’s deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller was “a world-class hater,” followed by an addendum that the president was a hater as well. (The post was later taken down.) While the statements were certainly defendable, they apparently violated ABC policy, and Moran was suspended, then dismissed. Moran, though, had one move left. On June 11, he started writing on Substack.

Moran was joining a movement based on a dream: Journalists could start a Substack newsletter and garner subscription fees that would match or exceed their previous salaries. And they would be editorially liberated! No editors to screw up copy, no censorship from bosses when advertisers complain, no corporate overlord to fire you when you say the president of the United States is a hater. Substack says that some people are indeed living the dream. CEO Chris Best recently boasted in a speech that “more than 50” of its users were pulling in a million dollars in revenue.

As more journalists get pushed out of their jobs, get fed up with their bosses, or just want to breathe the cool air of freedom, they now have what appears to be a viable escape hatch. Recently a lot of them are taking advantage of it. Jeff Bezos has been good to Substack: The Washington Post editorial page’s apparent recent disinterest in stopping democracy from dying has led popular opinion writer Jennifer Rubin to start a publication called The Contrarian, and censored editorial Post cartoonist Ann Telnaes now publishes on Substack as well. Former MSNBC host Mehdi Hassan started his own publication. Even Chuck Todd has gone indie.

You might be tempted to think that the Substack revolution is shaking up the foundations of journalism, agreeing with Substack star Emily Sundberg that newsroom leaders everywhere should be barring their doors to prevent further defections. Well, not so fast. The Substack model may work very well for a few, but it’s not so easy to march in and match a salary. Readers have to pay a high price for a voice that they once enjoyed in a publication they subscribe to. And writers have to get used to the idea that the breadth of their wisdom is limited to a small percentage of patrons. Is Substack sustainable for writers addressing a general audience?

Just in the last week or so, a cluster of critics have been publishing that the platform may be on shaky ground. It started when Eric Newcomer—posting on his own successful Substack—celebrated Substack’s recent influx of big names and reported that the platform told investors it was taking in $45 million a year in revenue. He claimed it was seeking a new investment round which would value the company at $700 million. (Substack did not confirm those numbers.)

This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter. SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech.

But then Dylan Byers of Puck looked at those numbers and wondered whether the bottom line valuation was actually less than in the previous rounds. Byers, like other critics, charged that once you get past the few real big earners, the platform was full of low-flying mediocrities: “The truth is that the vast majority of the content on Substack is boring, amateurish or batshit crazy,” he wrote. His conclusion was that Substack was a media company trying to be valued as a tech company, which is a familiar fail point for similar companies. (WIRED itself once failed at an IPO for that very reason.)

Ana Marie Cox, who once enjoyed blogging fame as Wonkette, is even grimmer, writing in her newsletter that Substack “is as unstable as a SpaceX launch.” She wasn’t impressed with the more recent influx of name writers. “How many Terry Morans does Substack have room for?” she wrote. “Is there even a public appetite for a dozen Terry Morans, each independently Terry Moran-ing in his own newsletter?”

Cox is referring to subscription fatigue, which is something I think of every time a sign-up page pops up when opening a new Substack. Typically, Substack pros solicit a monthly fee of $5-10 or an annual rate of $50-150. Usually there’s a free tier of content, but journalists who hope to make at least part of their livelihood on Substack save the good stuff for paid customers. Compared to subscribing to full-fledged publications, this is a terrible value proposition. After leaving The Atlantic, celebrated writer Derek Thompson started a Substack that cost $80 a year—that’s one penny more than a digital subscription to the magazine he just left! (The Atlantic will probably spend $300,000 to replace him with someone else worth reading.) It doesn’t take too many of those subscriptions to match the cost of The New York Times, which probably has 100 journalists as good as Substack writers, and you get Wordle to boot."
left,"For decades, the Blue Screen of Death, or BSOD to its friends, has instilled a mix of panic, dread, exasperation, and rage across countless Windows users. But now, Microsoft is getting ready to retire it. According to a Microsoft blog post, the Windows 11 crash screen—or, as the company puts it, “unexpected restart screen”—will soon adopt a distinctly more minimalist vibe.

Along with scrapping the blue (in favor of a perhaps even more dread-inducing black), the revamp also ditches the sad face emoji and QR code. All that remains is a single ominous sentence—“Your device ran into a problem and needs to restart”—along with a stop code and details of the errant driver that contributed to your PC’s misfortune.

A Black Screen of Death is something Microsoft has teased before. But why now? Why no more blue? And where did the Blue Screen of Death come from in the first place?

Out of the Blue: Before the BSOD

To be clear, there was no grand plan behind the Blue Screen of Death. Its origin story is a patchwork of coincidences and iteration. Even the term itself likely evolved organically, perhaps derived from “Black Screen of Death,” used by InfoWorld’s Robert X. Cringely while writing about a bug that affected networked PCs running Windows 3.1. That screen, you’ll note, wasn’t even blue.

Early versions of Windows did have bluescreens, but they weren’t really about death. Windows 1 (1985) would spew white-on-blue garbage when confronted with the wrong version of DOS during boot. Windows 3.1 (1992) used the same scheme for important system messages that required user input and for the rudimentary task manager that let you kill unruly apps or reboot. At most, this was Blue Screen of Mild Dilemma territory. When things went really bad, you’d get dumped back into DOS. Which also wasn’t blue.

Windows 95 moved things on a bit by not kicking you back to DOS when it imploded. But its system error screens still gave you the option to limp along, even if Windows by then was one wobble from collapse. A Blue Screen of Potentially Delayed Death, then. But BSOPDD never caught on as an acronym because it’s far too silly.

Blue-Sky Thinking: Evolution of the BSOD

The real BSOD, the one burned into tech lore, arguably arrived with Windows NT 3.1 (1993). When the system hit a critical error, it threw up a wall of white text on a blue background, which might help engineers diagnose an issue—or make the average user stare at it and weep.

So why blue? Years ago, former Microsoft architect John Vert explained that the color scheme matched his workstation boot screen and text editor. And when Windows crashed, the display adapter was forced into text mode with a basic color palette. Vert added that he was unaware of other Windows blue screens. In short, then, he chose what he knew and liked. Yet those arbitrary decisions stuck for nearly two decades, aside from minor tweaks to simplify the output to make it a little less terrifying.

Significant changes arrived with Windows 8 (2012), which was the first real attempt to make the crash screen user-friendly. But this being Microsoft, that effort included a huge, obnoxious, almost sarcastic sad-face emoji above text that read, “Your PC ran into a problem that it couldn’t handle, and now it needs to restart.” At least the shade of blue was nicer."
left,"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson issued a scathing dissent in response to the Supreme Court’s majority opinion on Friday that limited federal judges’ ability to temporarily pause President Donald Trump’s executive orders nationwide.

The 6-3 decision, authored by Trump-appointed Justice Amy Coney Barrett, allows the president to implement his order to end automatic birthright citizenship as litigation on the matter continues. As The New York Times reported, “the practice of giving citizenship automatically to the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants and some temporary residents and visitors would end in the 28 states that have not challenged the order.”

The decision is expected to have far-reaching impacts on other aspects of the president’s agenda, as he stated later Friday that his administration “can now promptly file to proceed” with policies that had been subject to nationwide injunctions.

Jackson, the newest member of the court, joined fellow Democratic-appointed Justice Sonia Sotomayor in a dissent that was also joined by Justice Elena Kagan, an Obama appointee. But Jackson wrote a separate dissent as well, in which she warned that the court’s “decision to permit the Executive to violate the Constitution with respect to anyone who has not yet sued is an existential threat to the rule of law.”

She continued:

It is important to recognize that the Executive’s bid to vanquish so-called ‘universal injunctions’ is, at bottom, a request for this Court’s permission to engage in unlawful behavior. When the Government says “do not allow the lower courts to enjoin executive action universally as a remedy for unconstitutional conduct,” what it is actually saying is that the Executive wants to continue doing something that a court has determined violates the Constitution—please allow this. That is some solicitation. With its ruling today, the majority largely grants the Government’s wish. But, in my view, if this country is going to persist as a Nation of laws and not men, the Judiciary has no choice but to deny it.

left,"Nicolle Wallace called out Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over his performative news conference on Thursday, which she argued did little to resolve the issue “haunting” the Trump administration in the wake of the United States’ airstrikes on Iran.

That issue, according to Wallace, revolves around one key question: “Has Iran’s nuclear program been — as Donald Trump asserted Saturday night and has repeated every day since — ‘obliterated’?”

During his remarks Thursday, Hegseth repeated Trump’s claim that the facilities had been “obliterated.” However, as Wallace noted, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, refused to use that word when describing the results of the strike. Wallace said Caine’s choice encapsulated “the whole issue that’s being debated.”

“Were the strikes successful in terms of hitting targets? Yes. But did the strikes deliver the result that the administration says they did, and says they wanted?” Wallace asked.

Wallace also tore into Hegseth over his treatment of the media during the news conference. “Here’s what happened when ’ Pentagon reporter, Hegseth’s former colleague, Jennifer Griffin, asked the incredibly important and respectful and relevant question whether the Iranians moved uranium out of the Fordo site,” Wallace said, before playing a clip of Griffin and Hegseth’s exchange, during which the defense secretary personally attacked his former colleague and accused her of being “about the worst” at intentionally misrepresenting what Trump says.

Wallace also praised Griffin for standing up for herself and her reporting:

That was America’s secretary of defense saying to Fox’s highly respected, highly credible, highly experienced Pentagon correspondent, ‘Jennifer, you’re the worst.’ And you saw her there take issue with the assessment and go on to defend her reporting, none of which has been disproven. It’s just a taste of what happened today at the Pentagon from the secretary of defense, whose salary is paid for by all of our taxpayer dollars.

left,"The so-called birthright citizenship case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday proved an irresistible shiny object to the court’s hubris, gleaming with the chance to address fringe conservative ideology and enhance the power and ego of the high court, all while it used its favorite new love: the emergency shadow docket. To put it plainly, the conservative wing of the court shouldn’t have even entertained the Trump administration’s arguments about birthright citizenship — and those justices have made it clear that they can and should diminish the role of lower courts through their prodigious use of the emergency shadow docket.

It’s difficult to see how fans of ‘originalism’ could read this to mean that children born in the U.S. aren’t citizens — but that is exactly what Trump’s Justice Department argued.

Consolidated from three cases in which lower courts stayed implementation of President Donald Trump’s executive order revoking the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of birthright citizenship, the case involved only the question of whether lower court judges can issue nationwide injunctions. But at oral argument, the justices couldn’t help themselves, wading repeatedly into the question of birthright citizenship itself, thus lending legitimacy to a once-fringe conservative theory.

The Constitution couldn’t be clearer. Section 1 of the 14th Amendment states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

It’s difficult to see how fans of “originalism” could read this to mean that children born in the United States somehow aren’t citizens — but that is exactly what Trump’s Justice Department argued.

Keep in mind that the 14th Amendment itself arose after a civil war was fought over the question of whether slaves possess the same rights as other people in the country — and was specifically meant to counter the backlash against Black people and recalcitrance in the Southern states to treating freed slaves as equals.

In particular, the amendment struck back at the Supreme Court’s racist decision in the 1857 Dred Scott case, in which it ruled that enslaved people weren’t citizens of the United States. The Trump administration’s argument rested upon an outlandish conservative theory that asserts the 14th Amendment’s grant of citizenship to anyone born in the United States is actually limited only to the children of freed slaves. It is a theory promoted by John Eastman, a law professor who was elevated from obscurity for his role in developing the bogus legal arguments used by Trump in his attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election. (Eastman is likely to lose his law license for making these arguments about the election.)

Despite the fact that the question before them was limited to whether federal trial court judges can issue injunctions that apply nationwide, the justices seemed incapable of distinguishing between that question and the underlying issue of birthright citizenship. In fact, that difficulty demonstrates the fallacy behind trying to limit or do away with nationwide injunctions because the underlying issue is always inextricably interwoven with whether an injunction is needed.

Today’s 6-3 decision fails to resolve this conundrum. Rather, it only further highlights the problems raised at oral argument — with the conservative majority focusing only on the authority of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions, while the liberal minority dissents accuse the majority of turning a blind-eye to the potentially blatant illegality of Trump’s executive order.

In a coldly beautiful piece of legal writing, Justice Amy Coney Barrett manages to capture the votes of all of the conservative justices with a deep dive into the history of the 1789 Judiciary Act. She concludes that in 1789, there was no contemplation of nationwide injunctions and, thus, using them likely exceeds the authority of the federal courts.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent — joined by Justice Elana Kagan, accuses the majority of enabling legal “gamesmanship” by the Trump administration that makes it so that “No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates.” In a separate, even more blistering dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson argues that the majority gives the executive branch “permission to engage in unlawful behavior.”

The dissents have the better argument, because they accurately call out the problem of the court’s reluctance to rein in acts of the executive.

The real reason for the court’s decision lies in its hubristic thinking that the justices really are elevated above the rest of the judiciary — not by the org chart of the Constitution, but by their legal acumen.

In their eagerness to convert themselves from being a court of last resort to a court of only resort, the justices do the country a disservice.

This was aptly revealed in Chief Justice John Roberts’ question at oral argument about whether nationwide injunctions were needed, given that the Supreme Court can act quickly in emergency cases. Roberts sounded self-congratulatory about the court’s alacrity as he mused that it had done the TikTok case in only a month. The chief justice’s question suggests his conceit that the Supreme Court can handle all the important questions itself via emergency docketing, so there is no need for nationwide injunctions.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion makes this plain, as he emphasizes the point that it is the high court’s job to weigh in on preliminary injunctions if they are important enough. Naming these situations as “the interim before the interim,” Kavanaugh says that in really important issues, it’s the traditional role of the Supreme Court to step in, thus reinforcing the diminishment of the role of lower courts. Implicit in Kavanaugh’s reasoning is the same arrogance that underlies Chief Justice Roberts’ view, namely that the justices are not only better at deciding important cases, but also should be the only ones deciding which are the important ones.

This view is startlingly myopic.

It’s myopic because issues like birthright citizenship are national by definition — they’re fundamental interpretations of the Constitution affecting all Americans. When they arise in a specific case, it’s critical that a lower court be able to freeze the status quo until there is enough time to fully litigate the issues. That’s exactly what an injunction does — it freezes the status quo to make sure irreparable harm doesn’t occur before the legality of the controversy can be properly litigated.

It’s also myopic because Roberts’ idea of speed is on Supreme Court time. Sure, taking a month to decide to hear a case and — in the case of birthright citizenship — another month or more to decide might be fast by high court standards, but in the real world it’s forever. Too much harm across the country can occur while Roberts and his fellow justices use their version of a “fast track.”

And finally, it’s also myopic because the overuse of the emergency docket shortcuts the full development of a legal case before it reaches the highest court in the land. The factual development accomplished through litigation and the appellate analysis of the trial court proceedings may all be jumped over. Often, the high court doesn’t even have oral argument on a case (although it did have it in this case), and typically the decisions are unsigned and can be quite brief in explaining the legal reasoning of a case.

Haste makes waste, and the Roberts Court’s inability to wait for cases to fully ripen deprives it not only of a full record, but also of making informed decisions about which cases to take. In their eagerness to convert themselves from being a court of last resort to a court of only resort, the justices do the country a disservice."
left,"Donald Trump’s condemnations of the nation’s free press are painfully routine, though the president has been a bit more hysterical than usual this week, and there’s no great mystery as to why.

Two days after the Republican declared that U.S. military strikes had “completely and totally obliterated” Iranian nuclear sites, the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency completed a preliminary intelligence assessment that found the airstrikes were less effective than Trump claimed. A great many news organizations, naturally, shared that information with the public after the assessment was leaked to reporters.

Trump and his team lashed out wildly, not only because of the leak, but because independent media outlets reported the news. In fact, on Wednesday, Trump’s personal lawyer threatened to sue The New York Times and CNN, claiming that the newspaper and the network damaged the president’s reputation by running reports that Trump considers, among other things, “false” and “unpatriotic.”

Time will tell what, if anything, comes of such an odd threat, but as it turns out, the Republican isn’t the only political leader targeting a media outlet under related circumstances. NBC News reported:

California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against  on Friday, accusing host Jesse Watters of defamation by falsely claiming that Newsom had lied about a phone call with President Donald Trump during a dispute over the use of the National Guard in Los Angeles. The lawsuit ... claims that Fox ‘operates as a propaganda machine for President Trump’s radical right-wing agenda.’

Politico was first to report on the suit.

The Democratic governor is seeking more than $787 million — and if that seemingly unusual figure sounds at all familiar, it’s because that’s roughly the amount of money the network paid in 2023 to settle a defamation case filed by Dominion Voting System.

Or put another way, Newsom and his lawyers engaged in a bit of political trolling when they chose this specific dollar amount.

“By disregarding basic journalistic ethics in favor of malicious propaganda, Fox continues to play a major role in the further erosion of the bedrock principles of informed representative government,” the lawsuit states. “Setting the record straight and confronting Fox’s dishonest practices are critical to protecting democracy from being overrun by disinformation and lies.”

The incident that sparked the litigation came earlier this month. On June 10, a reporter asked Trump when he’d last spoken to Newsom, and the president replied, “A day ago.” The Californian quickly responded that he had no idea what Trump was talking about, adding that the two had no interactions on June 9.

The president later clarified that he was off by a couple of days in his initial comments, and the story (such as it was) faded from view.

But on , the story unfolded a little differently. In fact, on June 10, after airing an edited clip of the president, Watters told viewers, “Why would Newsom lie and claim Trump never called him? Why would he do that?” The on-screen text read at the time: “Gavin Lied About Trump’s Call.”

In reality, the governor didn’t say that Trump “never called him”; he said Trump’s claim about a June 9 call was wrong, and on that point, the president himself soon after conceded that Newsom was correct.

“If  fails to issue a formal retraction and on-air apology, we will proceed with the lawsuit so that a jury can determine ’s culpability and assign a monetary value to its ‘blatantly unethical’ conduct,” the governor’s lawyers Michael Teter and Mark Bankson wrote in a letter.

Fox added in a statement of its own: “Gov. Newsom’s transparent publicity stunt is frivolous and designed to chill free speech critical of him. We will defend this case vigorously and look forward to it being dismissed.”

As a legal matter, Newsom faces a tough challenge. As Politico’s report noted, “Public officials must clear an extremely high legal standard to prevail in defamation cases, as the U.S. Supreme Court established six decades ago in New York Times v. Sullivan.”

left,"If you try to access Pornhub, one of the world’s biggest websites, from any of 17 US states, you’ll be blocked. Pornhub’s parent company, Aylo Holdings, has restricted access in response to a slew of laws that says Pornhub itself should be responsible for checking that every visitor is over 18. Now, the United States Supreme Court has made a decision on a key age verification law, which could have ramifications for the entire country and the wider internet as a whole.

On Friday, in a 6–3 decision that could reshape the landscape of online privacy and free speech, the Supreme Court upheld in full the Texas age verification law—one of the first passed in the country—requiring many websites publishing pornographic content to check that all visitors are over 18. The law, TX HB1181, says sites that are “more than one-third sexual material” can face fines of up to $10,000 per day if they don’t put in place age verification systems, plus extra penalties of up to $250,000. It also states websites should display health warnings about the potential health risks of pornography.

Writing for the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said that because the law ""simply requires proof of age to access content that is obscene to minors, it does not directly regulate adults’ protected speech,"" adding, ""adults have no First Amendment right to avoid age verification.""

In her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan argued that the Texas law imposes a direct and unconstitutional burden on adults’ access to protected speech. “A State may not care much about safeguarding adults’ access to sexually explicit speech; a State may even prefer to curtail those materials for everyone,” she wrote, “but the First Amendment protects those sexually explicit materials, for every adult.”

The ruling marks a major victory for Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, who defended the law amid fierce opposition from digital rights groups and the adult entertainment industry.

Legislators in Texas passed HB1181 in early 2023, but it was struck down in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas for potentially being unconstitutional before the law went into effect. Adult industry group the Free Speech Coalition, among others, challenged the Texas law on the grounds that it violates the First Amendment by restricting adults’ access to constitutionally protected speech. In March last year, a Fifth Circuit appeals court upheld the Texas law before the Free Speech Coalition took the case to the Supreme Court in a January hearing.

In recent years, a wave of age verification laws have been proposed in states across the country. More than half of US states have passed or have tried to pass age verification laws, according to a tracker published by the Free Speech Coalition.

“Efforts to regulate online pornography are often the opening move in broader campaigns to censor the internet,” Jess Miers, a visiting assistant professor of law at the University of Akron School of Law, said before the decision. “While this case focuses on mandatory age verification for adult content, state lawmakers are hoping it provides a legal foundation to impose sweeping restrictions on a wide range of online material.”"
left,"The Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed majority ended the term by ruling against the adult entertainment industry in a First Amendment case involving pornography. In an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court said the power to require age verification to access sexual content online is within a state’s authority to prevent children from accessing explicit content.

While agreeing about the importance of protecting children, Justice Elena Kagan’s dissent for the Democratic appointees emphasized that the First Amendment protects sexually explicit material for adults. “So a State cannot target that expression, as Texas has here, any more than is necessary to prevent it from reaching children,” she wrote.

An adult industry trade group and others challenged a Texas law on constitutional grounds, arguing that the verification process imposes too great a burden on adults’ access to legal content. Texas said it’s trying to protect kids in a public health crisis of pornography.

The question presented to the justices involved the legal standard courts should use to analyze the law. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals used a standard that’s deferential to the government, called “rational basis” review, when it undid a trial court’s preliminary injunction that had blocked the law. The challengers argued the more demanding “strict scrutiny” standard should apply.

Thomas’ opinion rejected both sides’ arguments about which level of scrutiny should apply. He said an intermediate level of scrutiny applies and that the law here passes it. Applying that intermediate standard, he said the law “advances the State’s important interest in shielding children from sexually explicit content.”

Kagan said in dissent that the law should be subject to strict scrutiny because it “covers speech constitutionally protected for adults; impedes adults’ ability to view that speech; and imposes that burden based on the speech’s content. Case closed.” She said the majority gave short shrift to speech rights and that she “would demand Texas show more, to ensure it is not undervaluing the interest in free expression.”

left,"The first time Republicans asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take a sledgehammer to the Affordable Care Act, they failed. The second time didn’t turn out well for the health care law’s GOP opponents, and the ACA survived the third effort, too.

Would the fourth time be the charm? Apparently not. NBC News reported:

The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a challenge to an Affordable Care Act provision that set up a panel to recommend preventive care services that insurers must provide at no cost to patients. The court, split 6-3, ruled in favor of the Trump administration, which was defending the law, saying the task force members are lawfully appointed under the Constitution's appointments clause.

For those who might benefit from a refresher about this case, let’s revisit our earlier coverage and review how we arrived at this point.

It was a couple of years ago when Judge Reed O’Connor of the Northern District of Texas — a jurist who has earned a reputation as one of the judiciary’s most far-right reactionaries — blocked enforcement of the ACA’s preventative health care requirements, jeopardizing everything from cancer screenings to immunizations, prenatal services to HIV prevention, pap smears to heart disease screenings, physical therapy for seniors to lung cancer screenings.

O’Connor’s ruling was based on the idea that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which determined which health care services will be available for free to American consumers under the ACA, was improperly constructed and should not exist.

Last year, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, generally seen as the nation’s most conservative appellate bench, predictably agreed with O’Connor and rejected the ACA’s health task force and its authority to require insurers to cover an array of preventive health interventions and screenings.

In Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, Inc., the Supreme Court justices, including two of Donald Trump’s three appointees, didn’t buy it. NBC News' report added:

The task force members are under the supervision of the health and human services secretary, a position held by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which addresses any concerns that it is not accountable to the executive branch, the court found in an opinion written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

This comes against a backdrop of other good news for the Affordable Care Act: The reform law’s enrollment totals have reached all-time highs, and public opinion research has found that the ACA has never been more popular.

That said, congressional Republicans have included several anti-ACA provisions in the party’s domestic policy megabill, creating the most serious threat to the system since Trump and Republicans nearly repealed “Obamacare” eight years ago.

Or put another way, Supreme Court justices have now passed on four different opportunities to gut the ACA, but GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill aren’t done trying just yet.

This post updates our related earlier coverage."
left,"The Supreme Court sided with Maryland parents in a dispute over whether parents can keep their elementary school kids out of public school instruction they say violates their religious beliefs on gender and sexuality. The court’s latest bolstering of religion in public life split the justices 6-3, with Republican appointees in the majority and Democratic appointees dissenting.

“Today, we hold that the parents have shown that they are entitled to a preliminary injunction,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the court. He said the government can’t condition public education on parents’ acceptance of instruction that poses “a very real threat of undermining” the religious beliefs and practices they wish to instill.

Alito said the parents are likely to succeed in their argument that the school board’s policies “unconstitutionally burden their religious exercise.” Writing on behalf of all six of the court’s GOP appointees, he wrote, “We reject this chilling vision of the power of the state to strip away the critical right of parents to guide the religious development of their children.”

The dissent raised a different chilling prospect.

Writing for the court’s Democratic appointees, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the ruling ushered in a “new reality” that casts aside long-standing precedent.

She said the majority “closes its eyes to the inevitable chilling effects of its ruling,” noting that many school districts, especially those without as many resources, can’t afford costly litigation over opt-out rights and the like. “Schools may instead censor their curricula, stripping material that risks generating religious objections,” she wrote, adding that the majority therefore “hands a subset of parents the right to veto curricular choices long left to locally elected school boards.”

Technically, the plaintiffs of various faiths didn’t ask to control what gets taught or to ban books. Rather, they asked for notice and a chance to opt their kids out of certain instruction, in this case sparked by books featuring LGBTQ characters.

Montgomery County school officials said the problem with opting out is threefold: “high student absenteeism, the infeasibility of administering opt-outs across classrooms and schools, and the risk of exposing students who believe the storybooks represent them and their families to social stigma and isolation.”

Represented by a religious liberty group and backed by the Trump administration, the parents appealed to the high court after a divided federal appellate panel ruled against them last year. The panel majority said it was too early in the litigation to grant the parents relief, over dissent from a Trump appointee who said the parents were put to a choice of either “compromising their religious beliefs or foregoing a public education for their children.”

The parents likewise told the justices that they faced an “impossible choice.”

School officials told the justices that the parents’ position had drastic consequences, accusing them of trying to “unsettle a decades-old consensus that parents who choose to send their children to public school are not deprived of their right to freely exercise their religion simply because their children are exposed to curricular materials the parents find offensive.”

In other religion-related rulings this term, the court unanimously sided with a Catholic charity in a Wisconsin tax case and avoided a contentious ruling on whether to approve the country’s first public religious charter school. In the latter case, from Oklahoma, Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s recusal resulted in a 4-4 tie that yielded no decision and effectively upheld a state court ruling against the school.

left,"It’s a tumultuous time for copyright in the United States, with dozens of potentially economy-shaking AI copyright lawsuits winding through the courts. It’s also the most turbulent moment in the US Copyright Office’s history. Described as “sleepy” in the past, the Copyright Office has taken on new prominence during the AI boom, issuing key rulings about AI and copyright. It also hasn’t had a leader in more than a month.

In May, Copyright Register Shira Perlmutter was abruptly fired by email by the White House’s deputy director of personnel. Perlmutter is now suing the Trump administration, alleging that her firing was invalid; the government maintains that the executive branch has the authority to dismiss her. Despite the firing, Perlmutter still characterizes herself as the Copyright Register. “Despite Mr. Perkins’s claim that he is Acting Register of Copyrights, I remain Register of Copyrights and therefore am required by law to fulfill my above-described statutory obligations,” she said in a declaration in May. But much of her lawsuit centers on how she's been rendered unable to effectively perform the duties of the office.

As the legality of the ouster is debated, the reality within the office is this: There’s effectively nobody in charge. And without a leader actually showing up at work, the Copyright Office is not totally business-as-usual; in fact, there’s debate over whether the copyright certificates it’s issuing could be challenged.

The firing followed a pattern. The USCO is part of the Library of Congress; Perlmutter had been appointed to her role by Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. A few days before Perlmutter’s dismissal, Hayden, who had been in her role since 2016, was also fired by the White House via email. The White House appointed Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who had previously served as President Trump’s defense attorney, as the new acting Librarian of Congress.

Two days after Pelmutter’s firing, Justice Department official Paul Perkins showed up at the Copyright Office, along with his colleague Brian Nieves. According to an affidavit from Perlmutter, they were carrying “printed versions of emails” from Blanche indicating that they had been appointed to new roles within the Copyright Office. Perkins, the email said, was designated as Acting Register of Copyrights. In other words, he was Perlmutter’s replacement.

But was Blanche actually the acting Librarian, and thus able to appoint Perkins as such? Within the Library of Congress, someone else had already assumed the role—Robert Newlen, Hayden’s former second-in-command, who has worked at the LOC since the 1970s. Following Hayden’s ouster, Newlen emailed LOC staff asserting that he was the acting Librarian—never mentioning Blanche—and noting that “Congress is engaged with the White House” on how to proceed.

In her lawsuit, Perlmutter argues that only the Librarian of Congress can fire and appoint a new Register. In a filing on Tuesday, defendants argued that the president does indeed have the authority to fire and appoint the Librarian of Congress and that his appointees then have the ability to choose a new Copyright Register."
left,"The Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration in curbing nationwide injunctions granted against his birthright citizenship order, in a 6-3 ruling with the court’s Republican appointees in the majority and the Democratic appointees dissenting.

“These injunctions — known as ‘universal injunctions’ — likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to federal courts,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote in a decision that didn’t decide the underlying legality of President Donald Trump’s attempt to restrict birthright citizenship. Litigation will continue on the issue in the lower courts and people can still bring additional challenges against the order, which Barrett said will take effect in 30 days.

The court also left open the possibility of plaintiffs bringing class action lawsuits, but whether any such actions would succeed remains to be seen.

On that note, Justice Samuel Alito wrote a separate concurring opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, in which he stressed the need for courts to police strict requirements for class actions and for granting any relief to third parties, like states, seeking to benefit from injunctions. “Lax enforcement of the requirements for third-party standing and class certification would create a potentially significant loophole to today’s decision,” he wrote, instructing the federal courts to “be vigilant against such potential abuses of these tools.”

The Democratic appointees were concerned with different abuses.

In her dissent for the court’s three Democratic appointees, Justice Sonia Sotomayor called out the court’s rewarding of the administration’s “gamesmanship.”

She noted that the administration didn’t ask the justices to fully block the lower court rulings against Trump’s policy. “Why? The answer is obvious: To get such relief, the Government would have to show that the Order is likely constitutional, an impossible task in light of the Constitution’s text, history, this Court’s precedents, federal law, and Executive Branch practice,” Sotomayor wrote.

“So the Government instead tries its hand at a different game. It asks this Court to hold that, no matter how illegal a law or policy, courts can never simply tell the Executive to stop enforcing it against anyone. Instead, the Government says, it should be able to apply the Citizenship Order (whose legality it does not defend) to everyone except the plaintiffs who filed this lawsuit,” she continued, adding that the “gamesmanship in this request is apparent and the Government makes no attempt to hide it. Yet, shamefully, this Court plays along.”

In her own separate dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the court’s “decision to permit the Executive to violate the Constitution with respect to anyone who has not yet sued is an existential threat to the rule of law.”

The administration appealed to the justices after several lower court judges blocked Trump’s executive order attempting to restrict birthright citizenship. Those judges did not consider the legality of Trump’s order to be a close question; “blatantly unconstitutional” was what one of them called it.

But the administration didn’t ask the justices to affirm the legality of Trump’s order. Rather, it asked them to curb the nationwide relief granted by those lower court judges, insisting that the judges should’ve stuck to granting relief to the parties who brought the lawsuits in Washington state, Maryland and Massachusetts. In that respect, this appeal wasn’t about the legality of birthright citizenship but about the general propriety of nationwide injunctions, an issue that has long bothered justices in all manner of cases having nothing to do with birthright citizenship.

Yet several justices raised the merits of the birthright citizenship issue during the rare May 15 hearing, quizzing Trump’s solicitor general, John Sauer, about when and how the court can get to the heart of the matter. Justice Elena Kagan pressed Sauer about his plea for the justices to let litigation over Trump’s order “percolate” in the lower courts; she told him it could take years to reach the justices under his approach, all while “an untold number of people who, according to all the law that this Court has ever made, ought to be citizens who are not being treated as such.”

The 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause says: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.”

Trump’s order cites the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” language in an attempt to deny automatic citizenship to babies born in these two circumstances:

(1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary . . . and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.

But “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” has long been understood to apply in narrow circumstances not at issue in this case. As a brief to the justices from constitutional and immigration law scholars explained, the jurisdictional requirement “exempted a narrow category of persons who, despite being born on U.S. soil, were not required to fully obey U.S. law. These included the children of foreign diplomats and hostile occupying forces, as well as the members of Indian tribes, who were viewed as members of distinct political communities.”

The scholars cited the 1898 Supreme Court case of Wong Kim Ark for the proposition that “[a]ll other noncitizens were subject to the jurisdiction of the United States while they were in the country.” That’s one of the cases Sotomayor mentioned at the May hearing, when she told Sauer that Trump’s order violates “not just one but, by my count, four established Supreme Court precedents.”

But maybe a more germane question is, why do physicists ask nutty questions like this? It’s never going to happen—just move on, right? Well, here’s the deal. Thinking about counterfactual scenarios gives us insight into how things work here in reality. Plus, it’s fun! Need I say more? OK, it might even help us build a working space elevator.

Oh, you don’t know what a space elevator is? It’s a sci-fi staple, a tether from Earth up to an orbiting space station in geosynchronous orbit. A cable-climbing car would ride up and down, just like a regular elevator. Basically it’s a way of getting out to space as easily and routinely as you ride an elevator to your office in the morning—no rockets required.

Let's start off with some basic questions and build up to some more complicated physics.

What Is a Day?

You can’t get more basic than that. But the answer isn’t simple. If you said a day is 24 hours, you’re right—and wrong. If you’re standing outside, the time at which the sun is at its highest point in the sky is called local noon. If you stand there until the next local noon, the amount of elapsed time is defined as 24 hours. So an hour is 1/24th of the time between two local noons.

But wait! This isn’t the same as a complete revolution of the Earth. If you measured the time of a complete revolution, you’d find that it’s not exactly 24 hours. The reason is that the Earth is doing two things at once: It's spinning on its axis, which causes the sun to appear to move across the sky. But it's also orbiting the sun over the course of a year, which means a complete rotation will not result in the sun being in the same position in the sky.

There are actually two different types of days. The solar day is the one you are thinking of, and it’s the one described above. The other type is called a sidereal day. Here's a totally not-to-scale diagram that will help you understand the difference:"
left,"Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have succeeded in transforming certain plastic waste into acetaminophen using the natural properties of the common bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli). This breakthrough represents a milestone with the potential to drive more sustainable methods of drug production and, at the same time, contribute to the reduction of plastic pollution globally.

The study, led by Stephen Wallace, revealed that E. coli cells contain phosphate, an organic compound capable of catalyzing a chemical reaction known as Lossen rearrangement. In general terms, this process involves the rearrangement of the atoms of a hydroxamate ester molecule to form a new structure called isocyanate, a chemical intermediate that, when reacted with water, produces primary amines. These substances are essential in numerous biological processes and in drug synthesis.

Using synthetic biology, the scientists manipulated the bacteria to redirect their internal chemistry and transform a PET-derived molecule known as terephthalic acid into the active ingredient in acetaminophen. They used a fermentation process, similar to that used in brewing beer, to accelerate the conversion of industrial PET waste into the drug, obtaining results in less than 24 hours. According to the findings, approximately 90 percent of the final product corresponded to acetaminophen.

Importantly, this conversion was done at room temperature and with virtually no carbon emissions, suggesting that the drug can be produced in a more environmentally friendly way.

Wallace noted that what was most surprising about the process was that the Lossen rearrangement occurred naturally within living bacteria, without the need for laboratory catalysts. That is, they took advantage of the microbial cells' own capabilities to trigger the desired reaction.

“The funny thing is that we didn't have to teach the bacteria how to do the reaction: The trick was to realize that they already had the tools, and we just had to guide them,” explained the researcher in statements reported by El País. “We used synthetic biology to build new metabolic pathways within the bacteria that guide their chemistry toward producing the compound we wanted. In this case, a drug.”

Sustainable Drug Production

The work, published in the journal Nature, could be the first documented case of acetaminophen production from plastic waste using E. coli. However, the authors stress that further studies will be necessary to achieve industrial-scale production. In addition, they caution that the safety and efficacy of the resulting drug in humans have yet to be evaluated, so future research will be required.

Despite these limitations, the scientists emphasize that their results open up new possibilities for addressing the problem of plastic waste and reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with drug manufacturing.

Currently, the production of drugs such as acetaminophen consumes thousands of tons of fossil fuels, especially petroleum, which contributes significantly to climate change. In turn, PET generates more than 350 million tons of waste per year, causing serious damage to the environment. Although this material is recyclable, current methods often result in products that perpetuate global plastic pollution.

“This work demonstrates that PET plastic is not just a waste product or a material destined to become more plastic: Microorganisms can transform it into valuable new products, including those with therapeutic potential,” concluded Wallace.

left,"Republican officials have been working on their domestic policy megabill — the inaptly named One Big Beautiful Bill Act — for roughly eight months, and as part of the party’s efforts, GOP officials have eagerly told the public about how great the far-right legislation is.

At least for now, the American mainstream isn’t buying what Republicans are selling: The reconciliation package is woefully unpopular. In fact, by any objective measure, it’s among the most unpopular major pieces of legislation in recent American history.

Under traditional norms, presidents will use their platforms and profiles to help sell pending initiatives like these, pitching bills’ virtues to voters. The goal isn’t just to make bills more popular, it’s also to make bills easier to pass: Members of Congress are less likely to support legislation if they’re under the impression that Americans hate the proposals.

With this in mind, Donald Trump held a White House event on Thursday afternoon, delivering a sales pitch while surrounded by regular people, including truck drivers, firefighters, law enforcement, health care workers and ranchers. The message behind the theatrics were absurd: The Republicans’ megabill would redistribute wealth from the bottom up, making the rich richer and the poor poorer. Any suggestion that the package is intended to benefit the nation’s working class is ridiculous.

But to make matters worse, the president’s sales pitch included obvious falsehoods. NBC News reported:

At his ‘One, Big, Beautiful Event’ at the White House ... Trump said: ‘And we will deliver no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors.’ The last part is false. The Republican bill backed by Trump does not impact Social Security taxes, and if it did that provision would have to be stripped out. Social Security is ineligible under Senate rules for the filibuster-proof reconciliation process that Republicans are using to pass the sweeping legislation.

Later at the same event, the president went on to say that there are “hundreds of things” in the bill — which is true, though hardly descriptive — before adding, “We’re cutting $1.7 trillion in this bill, and you’re not going to feel any of it. Your Medicaid is left alone; it’s left the same. Your Medicare and your Social Security are strengthened.”

That isn’t even close to being true: The GOP would cut Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming years. As The New York Times recently summarized, “The bill passed by the House will reduce federal spending on Medicaid by at least $600 billion over a decade and reduce enrollment by about 10.3 million people, according to a preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. [And] most of the changes to Medicaid have little to do with waste, fraud or abuse as defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service.”

Or put another way, as the Republicans’ bill nears the finish line and Trump tries to make the case for the package on its merits, the president is either lying about its contents, doesn’t know what’s in the bill he’s so fond of, or perhaps a bit of both.

We should find out soon enough whether such tactics are effective: Trump expects Senate Republicans to finish and pass the party’s bill in the coming days, then have the GOP-led House pass the identical passage soon after, all with the expectation that the legislation will be on the president’s desk by July 4 — just one week away.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at her latest briefing that the president is “adamant” that lawmakers stick to this schedule for reasons no one in the administration has explained. Watch this space."

Ever since, the Joybird Eliot has been the only pick in the “Avoid” section of our couches buying guide. When Joybird reached out explaining that it had revamped the Eliot (and its customer service—more on that later), I was skeptical about trying it. But I did it for you, reader, and I'm happy to report that after three months of testing, this improved couch earns a passing grade in my book.

From Swatch to Finish

Every Joybird Eliot couch is a custom, made-to-order affair. The Eliot is available in several styles and configurations. I opted to try the Sleeper Sofa, since I've been on the hunt for a good couch with a built-in bed for our buying guide. Joybird sent me a swatch kit full of delightful little fabric squares in a rainbow of colors. (Customers can get this kit for free, too.) There are nearly 80 different fabrics to choose from, including pet-friendly options and lush velvet affairs. Some of these fabrics add an upcharge.

After sifting through the swatches for a few days, I opted for the Royale Berry, a durable and plush pink velvet that was labeled pet-friendly and stain-resistant. The mattress had two options—Standard or Tempur-Response Memory Foam (yes, from Tempur-Pedic). The website has helpful tools like AR visualization, plus specific dimensions so you can measure for your space or for delivery.

There are some benefits and some drawbacks to this process. Since the couches are bespoke, the manufacturing process can take weeks. But on the positive side, these couches come with in-person white-glove delivery, wherein a team will come in and place your new sofa wherever it needs to be. This adds an additional fee that varies in pricing depending on where you're getting the couch delivered. Once the couch is ready, you can set a delivery date. Make sure the area where your couch will live is clear, and the team will handle the rest. Delivery of my couch took less than 10 minutes, and the team took the packaging materials with them.

The couch looked even better than I was envisioning, with well-constructed cushions and even stitching. It has two seat cushions and two back cushions, with a pull-out sofa bed. I like the mid-century modern styling, which blends in well with the rest of my house, and the hot, berry-pink velvet fabric is soft and plush to the touch. It's also durable and stain-resistant, and it's held up well to numerous spills. I love the way it looks in my living room, and I've had many houseguests say the same thing.

One of Scott's biggest complaints regarding this sofa was uneven filling distribution, which Joybird has since reworked. The company said it redesigned the corner blocks, adjusted cushioning, and worked with the supplier to improve the tufted buttons. Some specific Eliot models got further tweaks, like an added support beam. My couch has even fill distribution, and even though I'm the kind of person who sits in the same spot on the couch for hours every day (I usually work from the living room), mine has held up well and remains comfortable to sit on. It's a little on the firm side, which I like in my couches—I don't get that sinking, stuck-in-the-couch feeling that I have with some previous sofas I've tested."

Pressure relief is a crucial aspect for certain sleeping positions, like side sleepers, and those who need to show their joints some love. The term refers to a mattress reacting to a person’s weight as it contacts the bed, and how well it’s able to counteract the pressure from putting your weight on more tender areas of the body. For side sleepers, a bed that is too firm means your hips and shoulders will be crying out for help because of the tension. Materials like latex and memory foam are known for their pressure-relieving capabilities. Memory foam, in particular, is very adaptive and “hugs” the body, which many side sleepers like.

Motion isolation is a term used to describe how well a mattress manages to not transfer movement or shaking across the bed, usually from one person to another. When movement does end up disrupting the stability of the bed, this is known as motion transfer. If you wake up easily or share your sleep space with a partner, pet, or child, motion transfer is typically unwelcome. Memory foam’s density is usually right on par with absorbing this feeling, and coils have evolved to include fabric pockets (this is what the term “pocketed coils” means). The idea is that when each coil is contained in its own zone, motion has a harder time moving across the bed as opposed to traditional coils, where everything was woven together. Pro tip: Make sure you have a stable frame, as that’s half the battle here, too, and is often overlooked.

Spine alignment, otherwise known as lumbar support, is an evaluation of how well the spine is kept in alignment. When you’re standing up straight, you’ll notice that your lower back slightly curves. This is aptly called the “S” curve, because healthy alignment of the upper and lower spinal cord does somewhat resemble this letter. But your posture isn’t just a concern while upright, as a lack of spine alignment support while sleeping isn’t healthy in the long term. Each sleeping position brings about its own set of concerns, as even the smallest degree of sinking in this area can cause misalignment. Stomach sleepers need a firmer surface to keep this area uplifted, as something too soft causes the lower back to sink in. Side sleepers have to keep the hips and shoulders on the same level, and the lower back can’t be sinking into too much of a “U” shape. The alignment of your neck is key, as anybody with back pain will tell you. This is where many mattress makers have stepped up with their designs, putting firmer support in the center of the bed by way of extra memory foam layers or reinforced coils.

Edge support is important for a couple of reasons. If you’re someone who gets banished to the edge of the bed while sleeping due to a pet or partner making themselves comfy, you need edge support. Sit on the bottom while getting dressed? You need edge support. Engaged in adult extracurricular activities and don’t want to feel like you’re falling off the mattress? Edge support. Mattress models, especially hybrids, will usually strategically put reinforced coils around the outer edges to make sure weight is supported. This also helps with durability as time goes on, preventing the edges from sagging. Materials like memory foam can be hit-or-miss for edge support, especially depending on the firmness level involved. Too soft and you may be encroaching on feeling some sagging in any one of the aforementioned situations."
left,"Carson Campbell didn’t feel any remorse for his vote, and was even relishing in the chaos it might cause one of Love Island USA’s most contentious cast members of the season. “I love mess and I love reality TV,” the 24-year-old student and content creator says. “I love something with an end goal, when people are working toward a purpose.”

As a Love Island USA superfan who live-tweets and recaps every episode on TikTok, Campbell feels personally invested in how the reality dating show unfolds. Most reality programs are pre-recorded, but Love Island USA, an American spinoff of a British dating show by the same name that follows contestants at a luxury villa with the goal of finding love, is filmed in real time and airs six nights weeks (on Peacock) over a six-week period in the summer. Its format relies on votes from viewers, via the Love Island app, to help determine how the show progresses (you vote on favorite cast members, who pairs off on dates, and more).

That interactive component gave viewers the power to split up two contestants—Huda Mustafa and Jeremiah Brown—who coupled together in the first episode but had become too toxic for their own good by episode 13. Mustafa was controlling and territorial; in one episode she eavesdropped on Brown during a private conversation with other male contestants, calling him a “bitch” and a “pussy.” Brown was portrayed as a textbook love bomber; during a group challenge he confessed to telling 10 women he loved them.

When the time came to decide on their relationship, “we all agreed,” Campbell tells me from his home in Queens, New York. He often consults with his friends when a vote takes place. “America came together as a democracy and said we need them apart no matter who we have to throw in there as collateral. In the grand scheme of things, it’s not fair. But it was the right thing to do. Watching at home, we can see when something is going to crash and burn.”

The split sent Mustafa into a rage and her “crash-out” went viral across social media. “Peak cinema,” Campbell calls it. While a lot of fans appeared to be fed up with Mustafa prior to the shake-up, some worried about her well-being afterwards— “I thought Huda crashout would be funny, y’all I was wrong,” @daesbloodline posted on X. Fans have even tracked down Noah Sheline, her ex-boyfriend and father of her 4-year-old daughter, to express their disapproval for Mustafa. “You got one hell of an easy full custody battle ahead of you brother,” one person commented on his TikTok feed. Sheline released a statement on TikTok calling the fan obsession “unhealthy.”

“Her going on that show to find love, or whatever you think it was she’s doing, remember she’s still human, she has a daughter, and a life,” he wrote. “ I don’t like that I’m seeing so much negative shit on my page or even clips of it about her.”"

The last time I attended a Pride parade, it was 2019 in Washington, D.C. I had been to a few before — Portland, Maine, which I had just moved away from, and of course Boston, which is something of a rite of passage for New England queers like me.

Each one felt like a corporate and political spectacle. I met Sen. Elizabeth Warren at the Boston parade in 2017, not long before she unsuccessfully ran for president. My daughter and I marched with a group of colleagues from a former employer of mine, a local Maine bank, that same year, tossing rainbow-themed tchotchkes to the cheering crowds lining Congress Street in Portland’s downtown.

It’s hard to feel proud of yourself when the parade that’s supposed to honor your identity is sponsored by Raytheon.

I didn’t go to Pride in 2020 in part thanks to Covid — but also because I was getting tired of the “corporateness” of it all. It’s hard to feel proud of yourself when the parade that’s supposed to honor your identity is sponsored by Raytheon. That dissonance is partly what led me to stop attending those events.

But looking back now, those years feel like a quaint bygone era in queer rights. With Donald Trump sweeping into office on the back of hundreds of millions of dollars spent on anti-trans ads as he led a crusade against DEI efforts, corporate America responded in kind. And among the first items on the chopping block were Pride sponsorships and corporate support for LGBTQ rights.

This year, Pride has been marked by major corporations, some of which had been our community’s first corporate allies, backing out of major sponsorships. Anheuser-Busch, the parent company of Budweiser, ended its 30-year run as lead sponsor of St. Louis’ PrideFest and pulled back on its spending on San Francisco’s Pride events. Comcast, MSNBC’s parent company, pulled its sponsorship from San Francisco Pride.

Mastercard, PepsiCo and Citibank ended relationships with New York City Pride, while Booz Allen Hamilton, Deloitte and Visa pulled out of sponsoring WorldPride, which was held this year in Washington, D.C.

Where once companies felt free to pursue gay sales dollars, now they see political risk. All of these withdrawals follow extensive right-wing intimidation and harassment campaigns against companies that support LGBTQ people. Budweiser was at the center of perhaps the biggest controversy, when in 2023 a single Instagram partnership with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney resulted in a massive backlash and boycott that company executives say they’re still dealing with now.

Similarly Target, while not pulling completely out of Pride festivities, significantly pared back its rainbow-themed Pride collection. The company has seen a significant drop in sales following boycotts after corporate leaders announced it was ending its corporate DEI initiatives.

Corporate money in Pride has long been a point of tension within the LGBTQ community. Some organizers argued that corporate sponsors allowed for ever-larger parades, stages and event spaces in which queer and trans people could safely celebrate Pride.

But others within the queer community took a more skeptical approach. We suspected that funding and vocal support were only as good as the cultural acceptance of the moment.

Now that we’re in the throes of an intense backlash against trans lives, and by extension the greater queer movement and LGBTQ rights, the doubters are being proved right.

It turns out that corporations are all in on Pride if it means supporting customers with extra dollars in their wallet, but not so much when it comes to supporting our community’s most vulnerable, like trans people (who incidentally are statistically more likely to land among society’s poorest).

I myself have long been a critic of corporate Pride, or “rainbow-washing,” especially when many of these same sponsors also sent gobs of money to the very same conservative politicians seeking to take away the rights we have been marching for year after year. And now that these companies are retreating from their support for the community, I can’t help but get a creeping feeling at the back of my neck. It’s not just less funds to commemorate our community; we are less safe when major corporate players actively stop making space for us.

But maybe there’s something bigger to say about this moment. It was just us at the first Pride march more than 50 years ago. By standing up for our basic rights to exist, we all built a movement together that changed the country, and the culture.

The corporations may be retreating, but we still have a chance to stand together as one community, united in resisting the hatred and vitriol of those who believe none of us should exist.

Pride is still here. We are still marching on our streets for our rights. There may be fewer colorful merch items or shiny toys being tossed into the crowd. There might be fewer events and less space this June, but we’re all still here, together. Maybe it’s time for me to show my face at Pride again."
left,"This article is part of “Finding Pride in a Divided America,” a special series from MSNBC Daily.

In early June, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his decision to purge 17 members from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel of public health and medical experts who advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccines. In the following weeks he replaced them with anti-vaccine activists and leading suppliers of misinformation. We saw the consequences many feared from this action on Thursday when new HHS hire Lyn Redwood, a nurse practitioner and president of an anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy, presented data to ACIP on flu vaccines based on a widely debunked theory.

Kennedy’s reconfiguring of ACIP comes as part of his larger promise to, in his words, extend so-called “medical freedom” and “health choice” to all Americans.

Coming during Pride Month, the act of imposing his views under the guise of freedom and autonomy hits especially hard.

This touting of freedom, choice and independence has a particularly hypocritical ring this time of year.

This June marks the 56th commemoration of the Stonewall Riots, a week of uprisings in the early summer of 1969 when queer and trans patrons of the Greenwich Village bar revolted in response to police raids. While this year the month has been marked by the usual marches and celebrations, it’s also marked by a period when LGBTQ civil rights and cultural acceptance are facing an accelerated retraction, with an intense focus on rescinding health care access.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again movement claim that his policy moves will give Americans the power to make personal health choices free from government overreach. But this MAHA agenda so far focuses on “informed choices” like whether to get routine vaccines, seeking “radical transparency” by dismantling agencies responsible for the oversight of food safety, and focusing on individual responsibility for one’s health — rather than tackling systemic issues like poverty, racism and sexism that lead to worse health outcomes.

This touting of freedom, choice and independence has a particularly hypocritical ring this time of year. Not only are they a veneer for policies that will leave Americans with fewer safety protections and diminished access to health care, but they propel support for the Trump administration’s ferocious efforts to deprive queer and trans Americans of the very same decision-making power over our own bodies and lives.

The movement has placed groups like “crunchy” teenagers, momfluencers, and Gen Z and millennial women who’ve historically leaned toward the Democratic Party in a coalition with MAGA’s most far-right proponents. Using rhetoric about bodily autonomy co-opted from the reproductive justice movement, Kennedy’s movement and its (largely white) influencers have exploited real fears about fertility, food additives and pollution to generate support for another Trump election that paved the way for his administration to advance an anti-LGBTQ and anti-DEI agenda. And has it ever.

Since entering office, President Donald Trump has issued a flurry of executive orders targeting LGBTQ rights and DEI programs that impact the health and acceptance of LGBTQ people, including directing Kennedy in his capacity as HHS secretary to end access to gender-affirming care for trans youth and separately pausing funding for the PEPFAR program, which provides HIV medication and support abroad.

Under Kennedy’s leadership, HHS has placed LGBTQ people at the center of the bull’s-eye by stripping away access to health care and resources. The agency was reported in March to be weighing preliminary plans that would gut the CDC’s Division of HIV Prevention, which promotes testing, tracks HIV infections and conducts research.

In early May, HHS released a report by unnamed authors condemning gender-affirming care that the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said “misrepresents the current medical consensus and fails to reflect the realities of pediatric care.” “The MAHA Report” focusing on children’s health, released in May and laden with errors, echoes the earlier document, referring to gender-affirming care for youth as an unresearched “harm.” Meanwhile, the report makes no mention of intersex children, who are often forced to undergo medically unnecessary surgeries for atypical genitalia.

Beyond the federal government, two dozen states have passed bills targeting trans people in 2025 alone, according to the Trans Legislation Tracker, and lawmakers in nine states have introduced measures to weaken same-sex marriage, which has conferred the right for same-sex spouses to access each other’s health insurance and make medical decisions for their families. All this as the Supreme Court ruled to uphold a state-level ban on access to gender-affirming care for youth and has taken up a case challenging a ban on conversion therapy.

While Kennedy sets HHS’ sights on destroying access to gender-affirming care and HIV/AIDS support and research, the MAHA movement has taken up its own mantle on forms of gender-affirming care and disease prevention.

These efforts amount to an attack on the physical and mental well-being of LGBTQ Americans and seek to eradicate transgender people from existing altogether — an effort that Kennedy was complicit in long before entering government. On his own podcast and in other interviews, Kennedy has falsely claimed that pollutants cause gender dysphoria, comparing trans youth to lab frogs that can be “chemically castrated” by being exposed to hormones in one discussion with the alt-right podcaster Jordan Peterson, which was removed from YouTube in 2023 for what the platform said violated its vaccine misinformation policy. In step with this disinformation, Kennedy has claimed that AIDS is caused by poppers and a “gay lifestyle,” rather than HIV.

While Kennedy sets HHS’ sights on destroying access to gender-affirming care and HIV/AIDS support and research, the MAHA movement has taken up its own mantle on forms of gender-affirming care and disease prevention. Women leaders in the movement decry a “reproductive crisis,” not by calling out diminished access to abortion care or IVF, but by focusing their criticism on hormonal birth control and mammograms. Others peddle supplements like methylene blue, which is used to treat a blood disorder but is otherwise a textile dye that followers claim provides protection from Alzheimer’s and other illnesses (there is no evidence for this, but it does turn their tongues blue).

The basis for these concerns may come from legitimate questions about birth control and a sincere desire to protect oneself against devastating illnesses. Yet there is a deeply sinister irony to MAHA’s fear that grave medical injustices are being committed against them and their families. The movement seldom, if ever, acknowledges America’s history of medical experimentation performed on Black people, forced sterilization of disabled people, and “treatments” like lobotomies and exorcisms given to “cure” LGBTQ people in the past — all part of a craven legacy that the Trump administration seeks to censor by cutting DEI programs and criminalizing the teaching of racism, slavery and inequality. But for the very groups its leaders now target, MAHA’s greatest fears have already come true.

Half a year into the Trump administration, it’s clear that Kennedy and his MAHA movement are fortifying a pipeline from wellness culture to the anti-LGBTQ far right through policy, reports and the gutting of panels vital to supporting Americans’ health, while plying supporters with debunked wellness talk and empty promises of independence.

It’s the same tired homophobia and transphobia rebranded as health freedom, and LGBTQ people — especially trans youth — are being stripped of our choices until we’ll have none at all."
left,"In May 2019, Gillette released an ad on Facebook just in time for Pride month. It featured Samson Bonkeabantu Brown—a Black Toronto artist and trans man—learning how to shave for the first time.

“I went into my transition just wanting to be happy. I’m glad that I’m at the point where I’m able to shave,” Brown says in the video; later he’s seen shaving as his dad smiles and encourages him from behind his shoulder.

“Don’t be scared. Shaving is about being confident,” Brown’s dad says, repeating, “You are doing fine.”

The ad went viral, receiving national news coverage, industry awards, and praise from LGBT advocates. The Ellen Show tweeted that it was “nothing short of incredible.”

Gillette was not alone in creating a buzzy ad about the LGBT community as a marketing strategy; in the past two decades, there’s been a steady uptick in brands and corporations embracing Pride, a trend sometimes criticized as being superficial, or “pinkwashing.” But, as someone who has worked in marketing for over a decade, if you felt like this Pride month was a lot quieter than years previous, you’re not imagining it.

Five months into Donald Trump’s second presidential term, his executive orders against DEI and LGBT rights have influenced an increasing number of high profile corporate brands to abandon marketing and programming that could be considered too progressive, forcing Pride and Juneteenth celebrations around the country to scale back. At the same time, there’s been an influx of brands doubling down on nationalist messages in advertising, at least some of which appear to be tied to Trump’s tariffs and fixation on American-made goods.

“I've heard stories of clients wiping out … references to old work or old programs to try to erase that trail online because they're afraid of getting attacked,” says Mark, a creative director and former chief creative officer of a top New York ad agency who did not want his real name used due to potential industry backlash and repercussions. Where there used to be “a lot of activity and a lot of discussion about social justice issues,” he adds, there’s now a “void of silence.”

Welcome to the Trumpian era of anti-woke capitalism. Please check your pronouns at the door.

Advertising is one of America’s most popular and potent forms of cultural messaging, and signs of Trump’s “anti-woke” cultural crusade are all over our TVs, on our Instagram feeds, and in our communities.

According to a poll from Gravity Research, 39 percent of corporations surveyed planned to reduce Pride Month initiatives in 2025, with none planning to increase their engagements. And World Pride, which was just held in Washington, DC, reportedly received only around 30 percent of its previously projected 3 million visitors.

Mastercard, which famously launched a monthlong omnichannel Pride campaign called “Your True Self Is Priceless” in 2022 and, only a few years before, that developed the widely lauded “True Name” initiative that championed the identities of transgender Americans, has failed to debut any Pride messaging so far this year. Instead, it quietly withdrew as a top-level sponsor of this year’s New York City Pride, along with PepsiCo, Nissan, Citi, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Target, after receiving conservative backlash for its collections of Pride merchandise in years prior, released a scaled-back, beige-heavy line this year, which has been mocked relentlessly on TikTok."
left,"Vice President JD Vance is on top of the world. Once a critic of President Donald Trump and now his right-hand man, Vance is everywhere—with full MAGA backing. He’s on television promoting the US bombing of Iran. He’s a repeat guest on Theo Von’s podcast. He’s reportedly been key to negotiating the tenuous détente between Elon Musk and Trump. He’s even carved out time to enjoy an offseason soccer tournament match between a German and South Korean team in Cincinnati on Wednesday.

Most importantly, he’s also become the highest point of contact in the administration for the Silicon Valley billionaires who helped propel Trump to a second term. The vice president has a much closer relationship with these new players in the GOP than the president does, Trumpworld sources inside and around the administration tell WIRED.

Five sources, who all requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, described Vance to me as the most reliable link between the tech industry and the White House, something of a newly constructed bridge between the tech right and the populist MAGA loyalists who stood by Trump through the Capitol riot on January 6. Up-and-comers in the Republican Party have consolidated power thanks to both factions, but with Musk gone for now, Vance is the load-bearing link between the two.

To use a venture capital metaphor, though, Vance has only just progressed from his pre-seed to seed funding.

“That is the newest component to the MAGA coalition: the Silicon Valley libertarian wing,” a Trumpworld source who served in the first administration tells me. “I think they were appreciated and welcomed, but it still remains to be clear how influential they are when it comes to policy. When it comes to personnel, it seems like they’ve gotten a lot of their girls and guys in … but every billionaire in that room [for the inauguration], what have they gotten for it?”

For the 40-year-old Vance, his time working in venture capital and his Trump-era transformation have led him to become, as one Trumpworld source put it, the poster boy for the so-called loyal converts who may not have been on the Trump train in 2016 but have put enough money and social capital into supporting him that there’s no turning back.

“Practically everyone in his cabinet is a convert,” this Trumpworld strategist tells me. “Trump loves nothing more than a convert.”

What Vance converted from, in part, is an Iraq War critic who saw Trump as such a threat that he famously once self-described as a “never-Trumper” and privately said of his future boss, in a Facebook message to a friend, “I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn't be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he's America's Hitler.” After serving in the Marines and graduating from Yale Law School, Vance bounced around from a stint on Capitol Hill in Texas senator John Cornyn’s office to a federal clerkship in Kentucky to a brief stint in corporate law before cutting his teeth in the VC field at Mithril Capital, a firm founded by billionaire Peter Thiel."
left,"In the past week, Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough has ruled that several portions of the GOP megabill, the signature legislation of President Trump’s first year back in office, violated the chamber’s rules for the budget reconciliation process, and cannot be passed on party lines. Thursday morning, MacDonough issued a slew of new rulings — and dealt a major blow to Republican plans to rush the bill to Trump’s desk.

To avoid a Senate filibuster, Republicans are moving the bill through the chamber using the budget reconciliation process, which allows bills to be passed with a simple majority. But the Senate has strict requirements for what can be passed under budget reconciliation, and on Thursday MacDonough disqualified more than a dozen of the bill’s provisions under those rules, including several restrictions on Medicaid, student aid and other assistance for certain non-citizen immigrants, as well as a prohibition on Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program funding for gender-affirming care. Each provision, if Republicans left them in, would be subject to a 60-vote threshold — which means Democrats could block them. UPDATE (June 27, 2025, 9:25 a.m. ET): On Friday, MacDonough ruled against several more provisions, including increased penalties for disclosure of taxpayer information (which the GOP had pushed after leaks of Trump's tax returns) and deregulation of gun silencers.

Senate Republicans will try to save what provisions they can by rewriting the bill’s language.

MacDonough’s most significant ruling, though, concerned the bill’s limits on the Medicaid provider tax, which helps states obtain more federal matching funds for the program. That change already faced opposition from several GOP senators, including Josh Hawley and Susan Collins, who particularly fear its impact on rural hospitals. But Republican leaders have pushed to keep it in because it would save approximately $250 billion, a desperately needed offset to the Senate bill’s additional tax cuts. In total, the parliamentarian’s decisions threaten well over $500 billion of the bill’s cuts, according to a rough analysis from Bobby Kogan, a federal budget expert at the Center for American Progress.

Some Republican lawmakers criticized MacDonough after her rulings. On X, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala. called for “the WOKE Senate Parliamentarian” to be fired. Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., demanded Vice President JD Vance “overrule the Parliamentarian” — which Vance does not have the power to do.

In fact, while it’s true that the parliamentarian is unelected, the very-much-elected senators could overrule her at any time if they wish. But as Senate Majority Leader John Thune told Punchbowl News in January, “That’s totally akin to killing the filibuster. We can’t go there.” There are good arguments for getting rid of the filibuster, and Democrats even tried to change the filibuster rules in 2022 to pass a voting rights bill, only for then-Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin to join Republicans against the effort. But there’s little support for that path in the Senate GOP. “That would not be a good option for getting a bill done,” Thune reiterated to Politico Thursday.

Instead, Senate Republicans will try to save what provisions they can by rewriting the bill’s language. “But it’s not really clear how many of [the provisions] they can cure,” NBC News’ Sahil Kapur told MSNBC’s Ana Cabrera. Not that Trump will be interested in those details: Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told the New York Times earlier this month that Trump wasn’t even aware of the bill’s changes to the provider tax.

What Trump will care about, though, is how it affects the bill’s timeline. “The Republican sources I’ve talked to say this is not fatal to the bill,” Kapur reported, but “the bill clearly isn’t ready for prime time as is.” The Senate had hoped to begin voting on the legislation Friday, with the goal of getting the final version to the president by July 4. The necessary rewrites — and especially the lack of clarity about the changes to the provider tax — will at least scramble that timeline, if not delay it.

Republicans in Congress want this legislation off their plates.

Republicans likely could have avoided this slapdash process had they moved the bill along more slowly. “A slow process benefits the majority,” observed Kogan, as it gives them more time to ensure the bill’s language doesn’t fall afoul of Senate rules or contain other errors. And surely a bill that takes away health care from millions of Americans, mostly to finance tax cuts for the wealthiest, deserves a considered, thoughtful hearing?

But Republicans in Congress want this legislation off their plates: the bill is already unpopular and only gets less popular when you ask voters about specifics. And the president, with his approval ratings deeply underwater and creeping still further down, wants a bill he can sign and show to the cameras. The details — and the consequences — are someone else’s problem."
left,"It was about a week into my journey as a hydroponic lettuce farmer when I noticed my Mila air purifier, set to auto mode, was running at full blast. Its internal air quality sensor told me the air was dirty. Not sure if the sensor was overly sensitive, I swapped it out for the more powerful and far quieter IQ Air Atem X (9/10 WIRED Recommends) and set it on auto mode. Next time I went into my son’s room, the Atem was running at its highest speed. I checked the room’s IQAir Visual Pro Indoor Air Quality Monitor and noticed it was reading a higher-than-usual PM 2.5. For context, my sons’ room’s air quality index is usually in the teens or below, and that’s with my air purifiers running at their lowest, almost inaudible, setting.

It was at this point that I moved several other air quality monitors into my sons’ room. I noticed that there was a smaller uptick in PM 2.5 in other areas of my apartment as well. I took screenshots of my air monitor’s dashboard graphs and noticed that when the Plantaform’s grow lights were turned off from 10 pm to 8 am, the air quality improved. This happened every night, and I could see it on the various graphs from my consumer air quality monitors. I don’t pretend to be Berkeley Lab, but I’ve been covering air quality long enough to watch for patterns. I knew that Plantaform was using its fogponics system.

I had seen Plantaform’s cofounder and CEO, Alberto Aguilar, claiming, “NASA tech is going to revolutionize your kitchens … using NASA’s fogponic technology … ” on Canada’s equivalent of Shark Tank, known as Dragons’ Den. I was naive and hadn’t considered how a hydroponics system could impact my indoor air. I began to wonder if the monitors were picking up increased moisture. I’ve tested humidifiers in the past that impacted indoor air quality—maybe it was moisture.

I reached out to Plantaform to ask how their system impacts indoor air quality. They emailed back to say it might be because my air quality monitor was too close to the Plantaform, or the fogponics was impacting the humidity. Most of my indoor air quality monitors also measure humidity, and they were showing fairly constant levels of humidity. It did not mirror what was happening with the PM 2.5. The company also confirmed that the foggers continue to run at a reduced level during the night cycle.

I still couldn’t control my indoor air quality. And if I unplugged my IQAir Atem air purifier, the indoor air quality shot up above 150. For context, the NCAA will consider rescheduling events if the air quality index rises above 200. It was around this time that I remembered the included powder plant nutrients I scooped into the water. Plantaform’s own container lists it as fertilizer in the fine print. Their own warning label says, “If inhaled, move person to fresh air. If inhalation occurs or persists, get medical attention.” I looked up each ingredient. Soluble potash, boron, and fer are a few that can lead to health issues when inhaled.

I began to look at my growing lettuce with worry. I opened the window in the bedroom and was glad my boys were off at college. During the past two weeks of growing, I had developed my annual chest cold and asthma, though the hypochondriac in me worried that my giant egg growing lettuce might not be helping. I’m sure I sounded crazy when I mentioned the hydroponic lettuce egg to my primary care provider, who assured me that it seemed like my usual upper respiratory infection.

Health Concerns

I shut the boys’ bedroom door and found myself looking into some of the health risks of those exposed to indoor hydroponic growing systems, like childhood hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) or extrinsic allergic alveolitis—""farmer’s lung,"" or “pigeon breeder’s lung.” In reading the above linked study about a 14-year-old girl who developed HP due to an indoor hydroponic system, it was noted that they tested a water sample from the hydroponic system and found that Aureobasidium pullulans was the dominant fungal microorganism.

When I emailed Plantaform and asked if there was a water filter in the tank, they wrote back, “Plantaform does not include a built-in water filter, so the device uses the exact water you pour in to generate the fog that nourishes your plants.”"
left,"Before Ohio Republican Jim Jordan became a polarizing political figure in Congress as a pugilistic performance artist and slavish follower of President Donald Trump, he was a four-time state wrestling champ and two-time NCAA national wrestling champ who, in 1986, brought his talents to Ohio State University as an assistant wrestling coach. The 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds Jordan coached through grueling practices and brutal matches respected his knowledge and skill, and as they put it all on the mat for Buckeye glory, they trusted Jordan to be there for them. On the sidelines. In their face. Through pins and takedowns. Injuries and infractions.

The 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds Jordan coached respected his knowledge and skill, and they trusted Jordan to be there for them.

But multiple OSU wrestlers say in the new HBO documentary “Surviving Ohio State” that when they were subjected to serial sexual assaults by the team doctor, Dr. Richard Strauss, Jordan wasn’t there for them. According to an independent investigation published in 2018, Strauss, who died by suicide in 2005, “sexually abused at least 177 male student-patients” at OSU over a 20-year period, including at least 48 men on the wrestling team. And several of Jordan’s wrestlers during his eight-year coaching stint at OSU have included themselves in that number.

Multiple wrestlers say Jordan (who coached at OSU from 1986 to 1994) knew Strauss (who voluntarily retired in 1998) was abusing them and did nothing. Dan Ritchie, who wrestled for Jordan from 1988 to 1992, alleges in the documentary that the assistant coach directly addressed his athletes about the allegations against Strauss with this crack: “If he ever did that to me, I’d snap his neck like a stick of dry balsa wood.”

In total, six wrestlers have said that they had conversations with Jordan about Strauss’ increasingly abusive groping, fondling, trauma-inducing exams and that he acknowledged their complaints. But in the same way he avoided being pinned down as a wrestler, he has avoided being pinned down by reports from wrestlers who say he didn’t protect him and that they weren’t able to count on him for help.

This isn’t a new scandal. When it broke in 2018, Jordan immediately disavowed knowing of anything untoward about the notorious team doctor and was adamant that if he had known about any type of abuse, “I would have done something about it.” And, after having suffered no obvious political consequences over the last seven years because of the explosive OSU story, he responded to the HBO documentary in essentially the same way as before: “Chairman Jordan never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it,” his office said in a statement.

In 2023, as Jordan was vying to become House speaker, a former wrestler known only as John Doe, told NBC News, “My problem with Jimmy is that he has been playing with words instead of supporting us.” That former athlete said, “None of us used the words ‘sexual abuse’ when we talked about what Doc Strauss was doing to us, we just knew it was weird and Jimmy knew about it because we talked about it all the time in the locker room, at practices, everywhere.”

Chairman Jordan never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it. A statement from rep. jim jordan's office

University personnel, along with multiple coaches, were aware of the abuse as early as 1979, according to an independent investigation commissioned by Ohio State. What Strauss was doing, multiple students told those investigators, was an “open secret” on campus that seemingly everyone shrugged off. That report found that 22 coaches, 18 student trainers and “five team physicians and/or Sports Medicine Fellows whose employment at OSU overlapped with Strauss” told investigators “they were aware of rumors or complaints about Strauss” going at least back as far as the early 1980s and extending at least into the mid-1990s. But no individuals were named in that report.

As the documentary “Surviving Ohio State” neared release this month, a spokesperson for the university gave a statement to WOSU public radio that WOSU said “expressed deep regret and apologies for Strauss’ actions” but emphasized how long ago the doctor’s abuse occurred. That spokesperson, Ben Johnson, said the university is “fundamentally different today than when Strauss was an employee” and added, “Over the past 25 years, Ohio State has made robust changes to its culture and policies to protect students, faculty and staff.”

In the HBO documentary, former wrestlers at OSU recall the excitement of being awarded full athletic scholarships to a legendary sports institution as naive youths at the top of their game. They are in middle age now and forever scarred by what Strauss did to them and others behind closed doors. The team doctor’s pattern of sexual abuse — from inappropriate genital exams to locker room voyeurism and rape — was bad enough. What made it worse for many who came forward was the cold indifference of the people they say they told.

You expect a coach to have your back. A good one cultivates trust with his athletes not only as someone who knows how to win but also as a teacher of discipline, a model of even-handedness, a confidant of players under pressure, a protector on the field and off.

When the OSU scandal became front page news, not only did Jordan deny knowing anything, but one of his former wrestlers said Jordan reached out to him and pressured him to discount his brother’s story that Jordan knew and did nothing about his abuse. That person also said Jordan had called and pressured other wrestlers to “flip their stories.” It was 2018, and Jordan, a founding member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, had just launched bid to replace then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, and the scandal threatened to end his political career.

The scandal didn’t end Jordan’s political career. He has won three consecutive elections since.

“Another lie,” Jordan’s communications director told The Washington Post. “Congressman Jordan never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it.”

The scandal didn’t end Jordan’s political career. He has won three consecutive elections since — by his customary 2-to-1 ratio — in one of the most egregiously gerrymandered districts in Ohio. Jordan, who has never in his more than 18 years in Congress sponsored a bill that became a law, has ironclad job security in this red state. He also benefits from the fanaticism surrounding Buckeye Nation among Ohioans who bleed scarlet and gray and would rather not dwell on anything that detracts from the cultlike lore of OSU as a Midwest-proud powerhouse.

He skated from the OSU scandal without a scratch or a smoking gun that proves he knew of the sexual abuse that OSU’s independent investigation said was ongoing the whole time he was there. If some of Strauss’ wrestling victims are to be believed, Jordan could have stopped the harm being inflicted upon them.

But Jordan appears not to be the least bit worried about political repercussions for his reported cowardice.

Why should he? To this point, there haven’t been any."
left,"NBC News reports that the White House is limiting intelligence sharing with members of Congress after a leak of a Pentagon intelligence assessment of U.S. airstrikes on Iran this week undermined President Donald Trump's claim that he had ""obliterated"" the country's nuclear capabilities. It's the latest example of how Trump seeks to suppress information that's inconvenient for his political goals.

He has made it clear that he sees the intelligence community as an obstacle rather than an asset to his policy decisions.

It's not clear where the leak — an initial intelligence assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency — came from. But House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., says he's trying to figure that out. “There was a leak, and we’re trying to get down to the bottom of that. It’s dangerous and ridiculous that happened. We’re going to solve that problem, and we’ll keep the coordination,” Johnson told NBC News. He also said it was his ""suspicion"" that the leak came from Congress, but no evidence has been presented to back that claim.

The White House ""specifically plans to post less information on CAPNET, the system used to share classified material with Congress,"" NBC News reports. That's already infuriating Democrats.

“The administration has no right to stonewall Congress on matters of national security,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor. “Senators deserve information, and the administration has a legal obligation to inform Congress precisely about what is happening right now abroad.”

Lawmakers need intelligence briefings in order to make informed decisions about policy and fulfill their responsibility of acting as a check on the executive branch. If the White House ices them out, then they're hamstrung in their ability to hold the president accountable. That's of extraordinary importance at a time when Trump appears to be shooting from the hip on Iran policy in recent months, swinging from trying to secure a reasonable deal with the country to drastically changing the terms of negotiation to firing the opening salvo of what could have become a major new war in the Middle East.

Trump reaps a clear benefit from keeping Congress in the dark — he has more control over information that could strengthen his skeptics. And he has made it clear that he sees the intelligence community as an obstacle rather than an asset to his policy decisions. We saw it last week, when he responded to reporters’ pointing out that National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard testified in March that the intelligence community didn’t believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon by saying ""I don't care what she said"" and ""she's wrong."" We saw it when Gabbard fired two top intelligence officials who contradicted Trump’s assertions that the gang Tren de Aragua was operating under the direction of the Venezuelan government. We've seen it, too, in Trump's purges of national security officials seemingly in response to lobbying from extreme right-wing activists.

These are all concerning actions by a president who has the power to start a war. But they’re also not surprising coming from a president who has regularly wielded misinformation as a weapon."
left,"Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, one of the first young technologists brought on to Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has returned to government shortly after resigning.

“Edward Coristine joined the Social Security Administration this week as a special government employee,” Stephen McGraw, an SSA spokesperson, tells WIRED. “His work will be focused on improving the functionality of the Social Security website and advancing our mission of delivering more efficient service to the American people.”

Multiple sources at the SSA tell WIRED that Coristine has appeared in person to work onsite at the agency’s Woodlawn, Maryland, headquarters. One SSA employee says they saw Coristine with DOGE engineer Aram Moghaddassi, a current X and former Neuralink employee deployed at the agency. The pair was spotted at the SSA cafeteria as recently as Monday, although it’s unclear what day this week Coristine’s employment officially began. “Coristine looked nervous, almost embarrassed,” the SSA source says. “Aram was on the phone with someone … then said, ‘Yes, I’m with him right now,’ gesturing to Big Balls.”

Coristine and Moghaddassi did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Coristine’s rehiring comes after a White House official told WIRED on Tuesday that the 19-year-old had resigned from his position in government. A Trump administration official confirms to WIRED that Coristine did indeed resign on Monday, and then was brought back by the SSA later in the week.

Coristine became a full-time government employee at the General Services Administration (GSA) on May 30, WIRED reported earlier this month, converting from the restricted special government employee classification, which has a time limit of 130 days. As of Tuesday afternoon, Coristine’s Google Workspace account with the GSA had been disabled and his name did not appear on a list of DOGE employees on the federal payroll maintained by a senior administration official. The GSA did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Coristine was one of a handful of DOGE engineers who worked across many government agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Health and Human Services, the US Agency for International Development, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security, among others. Coristine isn't known to have previously worked at the SSA.

A 19-year-old high school graduate who worked at Musk’s Neuralink for several months, Coristine has gone by the handle “Big Balls” online and joined the government with no prior experience. He has also founded a company called Tesla.Sexy LLC in 2021 and worked for a startup known for hiring blackhat hackers; he was reportedly fired after being suspected of leaking internal information.

Sahil Lavingia, a former DOGE member who WIRED first identified at the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, told WIRED that “it felt like there was no real connection besides Elon being in the White House.” Speaking about an all-DOGE meeting with Musk held in March, Lavingia says, “the only person from the White House was Katie Miller.” Miller left the White House with Musk and now works for the centibillionaire.

Richard Pierce, a law professor at George Washington University, tells WIRED that the White House not knowing that a recently departed employee had been rehired was “abnormal, but it seems to be normal for this administration.”"
left,"The Supreme Court is needlessly shrouded in mystery. Among other things, it doesn’t announce which opinions are coming ahead of time, causing unnecessary anxiety and buildup.

Friday is a rare exception. Chief Justice John Roberts announced Thursday, as he customarily does on the second-to-last opinion day, that Friday will be the last day for the term’s opinions.

Six cases remain. These don’t include rulings that could drop at any time on the court’s so-called shadow docket, where the justices make relatively quick decisions on emergency applications.

With that in mind, plus the fact that we don’t know the order in which they’ll come out, the rulings expected Friday morning (starting at 10 a.m. ET) are:

Birthright citizenship (sort of). Technically, the overall legality of President Donald Trump’s attempt to curb the constitutional guarantee of automatic citizenship for people born on U.S. soil isn’t at issue. Rather, the focus is on a procedural aspect of the litigation, specifically whether trial court judges were allowed to grant nationwide injunctions against Trump’s unconstitutional order, as opposed to more limited rulings. But the injunction issue is important in its own right and extends beyond the citizenship question, and whatever the justices say about injunctions will affect the underlying citizenship litigation too.

left,"A Marine Corps veteran’s wife, taken from her two-year-old and three-month-old children. A fourth-grade boy from California taken from his father and detained at a routine immigration appointment, later deported to Honduras. An asylum-seeking 9-year-old girl and her mother parted from her stepfather and 16-month-old sister and taken into federal custody.

Those are just a few examples of the families ripped apart by the Trump administration’s cruel immigration policies. During the president’s first term, the practice of forcibly separating families of immigrants faced widespread outrage and protracted legal challenges. A 2023 settlement between the Biden administration and the American Civil Liberties Union banned that practice at the border until 2031. Yet in his second term, it didn’t take long for Trump to violate court orders and continue tearing families apart.

Migrant children and families are not “invaders.”

Amid protests in Los Angeles earlier this month over family separation and Trump’s broader immigration policy, the president deployed National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to the city. His top adviser Stephen Miller posted on X that Americans face a stark choice: “Deport the invaders, or surrender to insurrection.”

Framing immigrants — including children — as “invaders” is not just inflammatory rhetoric. It perpetuates dangerous, dehumanizing narratives and serves to justify violent family separation practices. Migrant children and families are not “invaders.” They are victims of U.S. immigration policy that has repeatedly torn families apart, inflicting lasting harm on child development and well-being.

How did we arrive at a moment where protesting the detention of a child ripped from their parent’s arms is met with militarized force? Although President Joe Biden called family separation “criminal” as a candidate, accountability for the practice never materialized and U.S. immigration policy continued to separate families throughout his administration . Now, in Trump’s second administration, family separation has gone largely unchecked, as the courts and Congress abdicate responsibility and cede control of immigration policy to the executive branch.

In its first five months, this administration has taken approximately 500 migrant children living in the U.S. from their homes and into government custody. As the examples at the start of this piece show, family separation is not limited to the border, but is happening in homes, schools, and courthouses across the country.

Although the Trump administration has emphasized that their focus is on mass deportation, mass deportation is family separation. “Shock and awe” deportation campaigns arefamily separation. As of 2019, an estimated 4.1 to 5.7 million children in the U.S. lived in mixed-status households, i.e. households with at least one citizen or documented immigrant child and at least one undocumented parent.

Children are especially vulnerable to trauma early in life, when brain plasticity is highest.

The Trump administration has also escalated attacks on migrant children’s rights. Trump violated the court-ordered settlement to provide legal representation to thousands of families separated under the Zero Tolerance Policy. The Office of Refugee Resettlement terminated legal representation for 26,000 unaccompanied children, forcing children to represent themselves in court. ICE raids and rescinding the sensitive locations policy have turned playgrounds and classrooms into places of uncertainty and trauma. And Trump is fighting the landmark Flores Settlement Agreement that limits how long children can be held in detention. Already, data show migrant children are being detained for longer periods.

This prolonged detention and parent-child separation has profound and lasting consequences on the developing brain. Children are especially vulnerable to trauma early in life, when brain plasticity is highest. Forced separation from a parent — or living in constant fear of it — triggers the brain’s threat detection systems, causing children to remain on high alert and increasing their risk for mental health disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Deportation of a parent can lead to drastic reduction in family income, forced relocations, and emotional trauma. These consequences are linked with emotional and behavioral challenges that can last into adulthood.

Immigrant communities are scared and outraged. Millions of Americans who recognize immigrants are our friends, our neighbors, and our fellow human beings are outraged. Protests — not just in Los Angeles but nationwide — reflect a growing demand for accountability. And should future leaders get a chance to remake our immigration system, they must not forget who is at the center of the harm Trump has wrought: children and families seeking safety."
left,"The latest charts from “Morning Joe” economic analyst Steve Rattner are in, and the new data could signal trouble ahead for Donald Trump’s economy.

On Thursday morning, Rattner, a former Obama-era Treasury official, broke down the latest projections from the Federal Reserve. As his chart showed, the Fed now expects gross domestic product growth of 1.4% in 2025, down from its previous projection of 1.7%. “This happens to match a World Bank number that came out a couple of weeks ago — two very impartial forecasters,” he added.

“So in Year 1 of Trump, we are going to grow, at least on track to grow, exactly half of what we grew in the last year of Biden,” Rattner said, noting the U.S. economy grew 2.8% in 2024.

I think it’s actually really clear Americans don’t want to go back into factories.” Steve Rattner on “Morning Joe”

The Fed also said it expected slightly higher unemployment in the year to come: “It’s now at 4.2, they think it’s gonna go to 4.5% by the end of the year,” Rattner said. Inflation appears to be following a similar trend, going up to 3.0% this year from the Fed’s last projection of 2.7%.

Overall, Rattner said he believed the numbers painted a troubling picture for the U.S. economy: “I don’t want to necessarily pronounce stagflation, but when you’re moving towards slower growth, more unemployment and somewhat higher interest rates, that is not the direction you want to be moving in.”

“Yeah, warning lights starting to flash. No doubt about it,” said “Morning Joe” co-host Jonathan Lemire.

Rattner also walked through some worrying news for recent college graduates. Citing data from the Fed, one chart displayed a 5.8% unemployment rate for the group, which he said was “substantially higher than the U.S. average.”

“Why is that? We don’t, of course, exactly know,” Rattner continued. “There’s talk that companies are starting to cut back on their hiring because of the economic uncertainty, the tariffs, whatever.”

Rattner said it’s important to put those numbers into context against the “changing set of views around the U.S. job market.”

“We talk a lot about manufacturing jobs; there are actually 400,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs in this country at the moment,” he explained. “And you have people saying jobs aren’t plentiful. I think it’s actually really clear Americans don’t want to go back into factories.”

Lemire agreed with Rattner’s analysis, adding, “That’s one of the points that critics have made when they suggest that President Trump’s tariff plan to build back manufacturing may be flawed.”

left,"Donald Trump’s housing secretary is embroiled in a controversy over ritzy and self-serving renovations he allegedly wants to make at the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s new headquarters at taxpayers’ expense.

No need to pinch yourself. The year is 2025 — not 2018, when then-HUD Secretary Ben Carson faced backlash after a $31,000 dining set was ordered for his office without the required approval from Congress. He ultimately canceled the order amid media scrutiny.

But in the world of Trump scandals, it seems all that is old is made new again: The current HUD secretary, Scott Turner, is now at the center of an oddly similar scenario.

On Wednesday, Turner held a news conference with Virginia’s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, to announce HUD’s plans to boot employees of the National Science Foundation out of their Northern Virginia headquarters to make room for HUD to move in. As secretary, Turner has taken an odd interest in slashing his department’s budget, cutting its staff and selling HUD’s headquarters in Washington.

Earlier this week, the American Federation of Government Employees claimed that it had been informed that new plans for the Northern Virginia building included a host of seemingly lavish alterations:

“A dedicated executive suite for the HUD Secretary on the 19th floor.”

“The construction of an executive dining room.”

“Reserved parking spaces for the Secretary’s 5 cars.”

“Exclusive use of one elevator for the Secretary.”

“A space dedicated to hosting the Secretary’s executive assistants on the 18th floor.”

“A potential gym for the HUD Secretary and his family.”

“This kind of let-them-eat-cake approach to government is absurd,” the union wrote in a news release. “At a time when they claim to be cutting government waste, it is unbelievable that government funding is being redirected to build a palace-like office for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The hypocrisy is truly dumbfounding.”

When asked about the claims at his news conference, Turner said: “That’s ridiculous. And it’s not true.”

“This is about the HUD employees — to have a safe space, to have a nice place to work, to represent the people that we serve in America,” he added.

As far as cringeworthy images of executive branch entitlement go, this story ranks right up there with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s office allegedly deploying staffers to bake cookies, which Burgum — similar to Turner — vehemently denies.

It seems we’ll have to take a wait-and-see approach with HUD’s new headquarters, though the fact there’s speculation at all is arguably a bad look — and one that is only shining more light on the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to downsize federal agencies and, seemingly, inconvenience much of the federal workforce.

At the moment, it’s not clear where the National Science Foundation employees will end up, but a General Services Administration official said at the news conference that the GSA will help the foundation find another building."
left,"After an “Appeal to Heaven” flag — a Revolutionary War–era symbol that’s been adopted by Christian nationalists — was hoisted over the Small Business Administration’s headquarters during its flag day ceremony on June 11, Democratic Sen. Ed Markey is demanding answers.

In a letter to SBA chief Kelly Loeffler, Markey, the ranking member on the Senate’s Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, asked for written responses as to how the decision was made to fly the flag and whether Loeffler signed off on its use. (Loeffler posted photos to X of the event at which the “Appeal to Heaven” flag was featured.)

Markey wrote:

In recent years, extremist movements that reject the legitimacy of our democratic institutions have co-opted the Appeal to Heaven flag. These include supporters of Donald Trump’s ‘Stop the Steal’ campaign, which falsely claimed President Biden’s 2020 electoral victory was fraudulent. On January 6, 2021, insurrectionists carried the Appeal to Heaven flag, and it has become a favored emblem of Christian nationalist and anti-government factions. Flying such a symbol at a federal agency on a day meant to honor the shared ideals represented by the American flag risks endorsing the messages of groups such as the Proud Boys and other white Christian nationalists, which seek to undermine the rule of law.

Jon Lewis, a research fellow at Georgetown University’s Program on Extremism, told Wired magazine that the SBA waving the Christian nationalist symbol should be “shocking to anyone who doesn’t want to live in a theocracy.”

Lewis said the incident amounted to a clear success for extremists:

Those who carried the Appeal to Heaven flag to the Capitol on January 6 did so because they truly believed they had the opportunity to inject Christian fundamentalism into the very foundation of our democracy, and the image of the same flag on the SBA will give them ample evidence they succeeded.”

While the Appeal to Heaven flag originated during the American Revolution, it has since been repurposed — largely through the efforts of Christian nationalist figure Dutch Sheets — as a modern-day symbol for extremist Christians, as well as neo-Nazis and other extremist groups.

Notably, the flag has also flown at a home of Supreme Court justice Samuel Alito and outside lawmakers’ offices (Alito has said his wife raised the flag, and some, like Speaker Mike Johnson, have claimed to be unaware of its contemporary associations). Yet the flag flying above the SBA headquarters suggests that the upper echelons of the Republican Party are unafraid of being associated with Christian nationalists or election deniers who stormed the Capitol."
left,"The Republican efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election were multifaceted, but among the strikingly partisan tactics was the fake electors scheme: GOP officials and operatives in key states created forged election materials and sent the documents to the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Archivist (among others) as if the materials were legitimate. They were not.

Though the relevant players didn’t know it at the time, the controversy has become one of the most consequential political scandals in a generation, racking up indictment totals unseen since Watergate and Iran-Contra.

The man widely credited as the “architect” of that scheme is still confronting the consequences of his misjudgment. The Hill reported:

Ex-Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, who helped devise President Trump’s alternate electors strategy in 2020, has been disbarred in New York. A panel of judges on the Appellate Division — New York’s midlevel appeals court — ruled Thursday that Chesebro’s guilty plea in Georgia’s probe of efforts to subvert the state’s 2020 election results qualifies as a ‘serious crime,’ a finding that begets disciplinary action.

The judicial panel didn’t pull any punches, concluding that Chesebro’s guilty plea on one felony count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents was “unquestionably serious” and reflected on his “integrity and fitness to continue engaging in the practice of law in New York.”

They added that the Republican’s misconduct undercut “the very notion of our constitutional democracy that he, as an attorney, swore an oath to uphold.”

It was nearly two years ago when Chesebro, among others, was first indicted in Georgia as part of the Republican effort to overturn the state’s election results. It was those charges that led to a plea deal, which in turn has led to his disbarment in New York.

But this does not bring an end to his saga: Chesebro is still facing criminal charges in Wisconsin as part of his role in implementing the Badger State’s fake electors scheme.

Because both the Georgia and Wisconsin cases relate to state charges, a presidential pardon wouldn’t help him.

Indeed, it’s worth appreciating the unusual nature of the broader circumstances: Chesebro is still being punished for trying to overturn the results of a free and fair American election, while Trump — who went even further to try to overturn that same election — was rewarded with the presidency.

left,"This is an adapted excerpt from the June 25 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”

On Wednesday, every Democrat who holds office in this country woke up to the possibility of a primary challenge next year because of what happened the night before in New York City. Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman and democratic socialist, is poised to be the Democratic nominee in New York City’s mayoral race in November.

It’s hard to see Tuesday’s results and not take a step back to look at what this means for the future of the Democratic Party and the existential question of whether it's up to the task the moment demands.

Mamdani’s success tapped into the seismic dissatisfaction among the Democratic Party base with the political establishment and status quo. Mamdani — a Muslim immigrant born in Uganda to a filmmaker and a college professor, who came to the U.S. when he was 7 — toppled a multigenerational political dynasty in New York and delivered a crushing defeat to the state’s disgraced former governor, Andrew Cuomo.

In hindsight, the knockout blow came during a televised mayoral debate a few weeks ago, when Mamdani took Cuomo to task over his many, many scandals and for his steadfast refusal to pronounce Mamdani’s name properly.

To Mr. Cuomo, I have never had to resign in disgrace. I have never cut Medicaid. I have never stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from the MTA. I have never hounded the 13 women who credibly accused me of sexual harassment. I have never sued for their gynecological records. And I have never done those things because I am not you, Mr. Cuomo. And furthermore, the name is Mamdani: M-A-M-D-A-N-I. You should learn how to say it.

Mamdani’s margin of victory, in the first round of New York’s ranked choice voting, was more decisive than even his most ardent supporters were hoping for. He managed to build a multigenerational coalition of voters along lines of race, ethnicity, religion and class, who stood up and rejected Cuomo and the political status quo he had come to represent.

At some level it is a new story, but it is also something we have seen before in politics. Two candidates that come to mind are the most successful Democratic politicians of my lifetime, former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.

In fact, in his endorsement of Mamdani on Wednesday, Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York said Obama’s victories in 2008 were the closest possible comparison to what we saw on Tuesday.

For some reason, the Democratic Party has forgotten how important it is to run genuinely talented candidates.

Clinton and Obama were very different figures, ideologically speaking, but, like Mamdani, they represented a kind of generational shift against the party’s old guard. Clinton and Obama were both considered long-shot candidates when they first announced their intentions to run for the presidency. But the two men managed to put together winning coalitions in large part by rejecting a party establishment that was seen as increasingly out of touch with voters.

However, for some reason, the Democratic Party has forgotten how important it is to run genuinely talented candidates rather than handing the reins to the people who have simply waited their turn. That strategy has proven catastrophic.

Hillary Clinton won the party’s nomination in 2016 largely on the argument that it was her time to serve. She lost to Donald Trump. Despite pledging to serve as a bridge to a new generation of leaders, Joe Biden made the shockingly short-sighted decision to run again in 2024, before dropping out at the last minute and handing the nomination to the person next in line.

But, even after those defeats, so many figures in the party establishment have still failed to get the message. That’s how we got high-profile figures like Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn and Clinton himself telling voters that a disgraced 67-year-old former governor is the future of their party instead of an outsider candidate who manages to inspire voters.

Mamdani's success should serve as a wake-up call for Democrats. The party needs to elevate voices from outside the establishment. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont may have fallen short in his 2016 campaign, but he inspired a once-in-a-generation realignment within the Democratic base.

Sanders’ campaign inspired a young bartender from the Bronx, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, to unseat an establishment Democratic congressman in New York. Ocasio-Cortez’s upset victory in 2018 in turn inspired Mamdani to run for the New York State assembly two years later.

To be clear, a few months ago, Mamdani’s victory would have been inconceivable. He faced a massive uphill battle to get to Tuesday's results. An Emerson University poll from February of this year showed him with 1% support.

Mamdani also had to overcome some really ugly, Islamophobic smears due to his long-standing and unflinching pro-Palestinian politics and criticism of Israel. Additionally, he faced real skepticism from lots of Jewish New Yorkers who have seen antisemitic attacks and vandalism in this city and go to synagogues with security watching over them.

Mamdani's success should serve as a wake-up call for Democrats.

But Mamdani overcame the odds by running an extraordinary campaign and, in large part, by staying relentlessly, laser-focused on one issue: affordability. Like Clinton’s “It’s the economy, stupid,” or Obama’s message of “Hope and change,” or even Trump’s “Make America Great Again,” Mamdani ran on one consistent principle: Make New York City more affordable.

He also did an excellent job meeting voters where they are. Mamdani first went viral with a video outlining his plan to lower the price of a New York City staple: Food from Halal trucks.

Mamdani masterfully gamed the ""attention economy"" from that point on, and much like Trump and JD Vance in 2024, he cast as wide a net as possible, essentially never declining a media appearance, whether that was a conversation with the centrist Bulwark podcast, an interview with an Urdu-language news channel, or just a fun video with the popular internet talk show, Subway Takes.

What Mamdani did in New York over the past few months shows that there are solutions to the problems that have caused Democrats so much despair since November’s election. Mamdani thrived with young men and in immigrant communities across the city, two demographics that drifted towards Trump less than a year ago.

Of course, Republicans are champing at the bit to smear Mamdani and try to tie him to the future of the Democratic Party. In fact, in between his NATO meetings and travel, Trump went after Mamdani on Truth Social calling him a “Communist Lunatic.”

So while it remains to be seen how much of Mamdani’s success can be replicated across the country, it is clear he has tapped into something special."
left,"Attorney General Pam Bondi is facing bipartisan backlash over a reported plan to merge the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives with the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Liberals have opposed the Trump administration’s unilateral moves to dismantle, downsize, rearrange and repurpose congressionally authorized agencies since the president took office — and the response to the planned ATF-DEA merger has been no different. The plan has particularly alarmed liberals, like the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, who are concerned about the government’s ability to enforce gun laws if Trump follows through with reported plans to cut hundreds of investigators.

A Reuters report from mid-May laid out some of the challenges posed by the plan:

A merger of the ATF and DEA would represent one of the biggest shakeups of the Justice Department since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. It would also pose a challenging task for the Justice Department to seamlessly try to combine the DEA’s complex role of regulating pharmacies, doctors and drug manufacturers, and the ATF’s responsibility for regulating the firearms industry.

At a hearing earlier this week, Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro grilled Bondi over the planned cuts as the two debated the merits of the merger. DeLauro questioned how either agency could fulfill its duties better than it does now if the Trump administration is proposing cuts to both their budgets. Bondi argued the merger was being undertaken in the name of efficiency. “Everyone knows, everyone sitting up here knows guns and drugs go together,” she argued.

But a number of large, conservative gun groups aren’t too keen on the proposal either. During her exchange with DeLauro, Bondi claimed “ATF agents will not be knocking on the doors of legal gun owners in the middle of the night asking them about their guns.” That may have been a nod to the pro-gun groups that sent Bondi a letter expressing their opposition to the plan over concerns it would “create a super-entity of gun control enforcers, and empower future administrations to target the Second Amendment community in unprecedented ways.”

“That does not align with President Trump’s policy agenda,” the groups wrote, “and it certainly is not what the President was elected with the help of gun owners to accomplish.” The Second Amendment Foundation, a conservative gun advocacy group, coordinated the letter and sent it to Bondi in early June. The group reshared the letter on its X account after Bondi’s testimony and urged her to reconsider the merger.

It’s rare to see liberals like DeLauro, a supporter of comprehensive gun safety legislation, and Trump-friendly gun advocacy groups finding common ground — even if their reasons for opposing the administration’s plan certainly differ. But fundamentally, this eyebrow-raising move is generating clear bipartisan unease about what it might portend for the future."
left,"In a blow to the Democratic Party establishment, Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist and a state assemblyman from Queens, all but secured a victory in the New York Democratic mayoral primary on Tuesday. (The race may not be called until next week due to ranked choice voting procedures, but his main competitor, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has already conceded.)

There are a number of factors that explain Mamdani’s decisive lead. He radiates charisma that even his rivals can’t help but comment on. He uses social media with adroitness not seen perhaps since Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s first run for Congress. He had a jaw-dropping ground game, an army of happy warriors who swarmed the city canvassing for months and helped turn him from a little-known lawmaker in New York into a candidate with national name recognition.

Mamdani’s socialism is key to understanding his policy ideas — and their appeal.

But none of this would have come together had it not been for Mamdani’s central vision: a campaign laser-focused on the “crisis of affordability” in New York City and driven by hugely ambitious policy proposals to tackle it. Mamdani has not yet won the general election, but his insurgent campaign still has lessons for a party that has failed to find its voice on economic policy at a time of plummeting trust in institutions and skepticism of neoliberal economic thinking.

As establishment Democrats are casting about for ways to restore their tattered brand, Mamdani is showing how the left can make economic populism the centerpiece of political campaigns and wrest it back from the right. But it requires the willingness to be seen as polarizing, and the confidence to try to persuade the electorate.

In his campaign, Mamdani constantly talks with empathy and ambition about how to fix the cost of housing, mass transit, child care and groceries. The expensiveness of daily life is at the center of his campaign speeches, debate rhetoric, his website, his viral social media clips, his mailers. At certain points he has attributed this relentless focus as a response to what he’s seen in the polls and what he hears constantly from residents. “This is a city that we want to ensure does not become a museum or a relic of the working-class people who built it, but rather a living, breathing testament to the continuation of that story,” Mamdani recently told The New York Times.

But it would be a mistake to see Mamdani’s economic vision as a mere expression of “popularism,” a term used by a faction of Democratic commentators and analysts who (often naively) argue that the party Dems should only align themselves with policies and rhetoric that poll highly at the current moment. (Indeed, some popularists have tried to claim that Mamdani reflects their values.) While some of Mamdani’s specific points of focus might be tied to polls, the way he approaches economic issues also clearly emanates from an ideological commitment to left-wing class-first politics. He has been a member of the Democratic Socialists of America since 2017 and worked as a foreclosure-prevention counselor for a housing justice organization before entering office. He favors economic policies centered around the lives of working-class people and pursues them with an activist sensibility. He first made a splash as an assemblyman in 2021 by joining New York City cab drivers in a successful 15-day hunger strike lobbying for relief from excessive debt. It's safe to wager that he didn't defend the idea of free bus fares because of the Democratic consulting class.

Mamdani’s socialism is key to understanding his policy ideas — and their appeal. His solution for the cost of bus fares has been to propose making city buses free. His solution to bringing down the exorbitant cost of child care in the city has been to propose making it free. His solution for helping New Yorkers deal with the high cost of groceries has been a public option for city-owned grocery stores with subsidized goods. He also wants to freeze rent and build huge amounts of affordable housing. And, he wants to pay for these policies with a big tax hike on corporations and the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers.

Mamdani doesn’t view policy through the prism of technocratic tweaking, he strives to turn vital services into social democratic goods. “To be a democratic socialist means that you are committed to the state providing for people that which is necessary to live a dignified life,” Mamdani said as he first ran for New York state assembly in 2020.

Mamdani also showcased how a leftie politician can remain focused on economic issues even in the face of culture wars from the right.

Let’s set aside whether one thinks every single one of these policies is wise or practical given the fiscal and bureaucratic constraints Mamdani would face as mayor. At the very least it should be clear how the ambition of his proposals can excite voters. It should also be clear how the simplicity of the proposals makes them easily digestible, memorable and memetic. Proposals can telegraph policy priorities and vision even if they are not literally fulfilled, although most politicians do in fact try to fulfill most policy pledges. (To take an example of a politician who communicates successfully through sweeping, symbolic language, President Donald Trump has accurately forecast many of his policies on immigration, protectionist trade and foreign policy through simple slogans like “build the wall,” “America first” and ending “cheating” on trade.)

Mamdani also showcased how a leftie politician can remain focused on economic issues even in the face of culture wars from the right. Cuomo, a conservative Democrat, played a Trumpian role in the race, painting New York as a hellscape that he alone could fix, and constantly tried to hammer Mamdani on his perceived weak spots on noneconomic issues. That included accusing Mamdani of trying to defund the police, a position he took in 2020. In this race Mamdani took a softer position on police reform, saying the police had a “critical role to play,” but proposed a department of community safety which would “invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response — including deploying dedicated outreach workers in 100 subway stations.” He has also called for cuts to the police’s overtime budget and its notoriously repressive unit that responds to protests. This allowed Mamdani to push back against defund accusations while also proposing a real noncarceral solutions to real problems in New York.

Cuomo and his allies — with the complicity of mainstream media framing — also ran a shameful smear campaign attempting to paint Mamdani as an antisemite based on his positions calling Israel an apartheid state, accusing it of committing genocide and calling for it to comply with democratic principles instead of ethnocratic ones. I don’t agree with everything about Mamdani’s approach to the issue, but he showed sensitivity throughout his campaign. He did substantial outreach to the Jewish community and continually explained how he takes antisemitism very seriously and wants to proactively tackle the issue with measures such as increasing funds to prevent hate crimes. And he stuck by his objections to Israel’s policies and actions toward Palestinians.

In other words, Mamdani did not simply run on what seemed popular. His campaign successfully foregrounded a deeply populist economic program, while also showing both strong principles and sensitivity on policy fronts where the left is considered vulnerable. This helped give him that coveted quality all politicians long for — “authenticity” — which in turn builds trust.

Mamdani has illustrated how Democrats can excite people through an universalistic economic vision, by thinking big and showing the confidence to persuade voters. The party should take notice."
left,"Lauren Goode: Well, speaking of Darth Vader, Disney recently licensed the use of Darth Vader's voice for a chatbot in Fortnite. Everybody knows what Fortnite is, right? And what's interesting about this is this deal ended up causing some backlash from the actors in SAG-AFTRA, which is the union that represents actors and voice actors and stuff like that, where they were arguing that this is an example of AI-generated voices replacing their work, their very human work, without authorization, and Disney has also reportedly been in conversations with companies like OpenAI about potential partnerships. So what's interesting about this lawsuit is it's Disney pushing back against Midjourney for what it feels is unfair and illegal use of its intellectual property, but Disney itself is taking these steps to embrace AI in Hollywood.

Katie Drummond: Well, and I think all of these lawsuits and this lawsuit, and then just even these deals that Disney is doing, these licensing deals, all of it combined I think just highlights how little regulation or legislation exists around how AI can and cannot be used when it comes to copyrighted work and IP. And so you're basically asking courts to make their own judgments on these cases, but there's no framework really to underpin exactly what they are deciding on or what those decisions are based on. Kate, is that your understanding of where we are in terms of any sort of actual regulation around this?

Kate Knibbs: Yeah, it's definitely I think going to be something that the courts are going to be left to decide, especially because the Big Beautiful Bill's ten year moratorium on AI legislation at the state level seems to be going. And I will say, a lot of people on both sides don't seem that upset about this. I think there's a sense that it might be really difficult to regulate this properly without stifling innovation. We're not seeing a huge clamoring for federal law to provide the guard rails here. Basically, it's going to be decided by the courts. Probably the first case that goes will go all the way up to SCOTUS.

Michael Calore: Wow. I hope that Yoda smoking a joint is on the official record at the US Supreme Court. All right. Well, let's take a quick break and we'll come right back. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. So we've been talking about the recent lawsuit filed by Disney and Universal against Midjourney, but the AI copyright battle isn't just happening in Hollywood, it's happening everywhere. And our guest today, Kate Knibbs, created a tracking page where WIRED readers can see how AI copyright lawsuits are unfolding across many industries. Kate, can you tell us about some of the main lawsuits that have caught your eye, and which industries seem to be the most active in suing AI companies?

Kate Knibbs: So there was a lot of movement initially with book authors suing AI companies and then now media outlets suing them, visual artists, and more recently, there have been some music labels. The Disney case is also notable because it's the first time Hollywood Studios jumped in. They weren't really in this world yet. The media companies, I would say the biggest player there is the New York Times, which is suing OpenAI. The lawsuit that it filed, I heard similar things about that one that I did about the Disney one, which is that it's just exceptionally well argued and it had a lot of emphasis on showing outputs of the LLMs that were identical to New York Times articles. So that one is definitely a major one to watch, but there have been some movement in a few others. Kadri versus Meta, which is Richard Kadri is a novelist, a group of novelists sued Meta. That one's been really spicy because it came out in discovery that Meta had pirated a lot of the books that it ended up training on and it openly admits that it did this, and the judge who's sitting on that case is just a character, so I really like watching the hearings for entertainment value. If anyone out there is as big of a nerd as I am, you can live stream them, and I recommend it. That might be one of the first to either go to trial or go to summary judgment. And then Barts verse Anthropic is another novelist. That one is also progressing quickly and the judge sitting is really well known being well-versed in fair use, so something might happen there. And then Suno and Udio, that are two AI song generators, they got sued by the major music labels, more recently, but there have been talks happening already between the labels and the song generators, settlement talks. So if those settle, that will be a huge deal because we've been looking for what's going to go to trial and what's going to settle. I could go on, but I think those are the ones that I think you guys should know about."
left,"The Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed majority rejected a lawsuit from Planned Parenthood and one of its patients on Thursday, over dissent from the court’s Democratic appointees who said the ruling portends “tangible harm to real people.”

The dispute stems from the GOP’s opposition to abortion. But the case implicates unrelated care for Medicaid recipients, like cancer screenings, blood work and annual physicals, at a time when Republicans are pushing for Medicaid cuts.

In 2018, South Carolina’s Republican governor, Henry McMaster, sought to bar abortion clinics from Medicaid participation, and the state told Planned Parenthood that it could no longer service Medicaid beneficiaries. That raised legal questions under part of the Medicaid Act known as the “free choice of provider” provision, which tells states to let anyone eligible for assistance obtain care from any qualified provider.

The Medicaid beneficiary in the case, Julie Edwards, received contraceptive care through Planned Parenthood and wanted to move all of her gynecological and reproductive health care there. But she said she wouldn’t be able to do that unless the services were covered by Medicaid.

A federal appeals court panel backed her suit, reasoning that the choice-of-provider provision “specifies an entitlement given to each Medicaid beneficiary: to choose one’s preferred qualified provider without state interference.” In the decision, written by Reagan appointee J. Harvie Wilkinson III, the appeals court said the provision couldn’t be clearer about conferring rights.

But the Supreme Court disagreed in an opinion from Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch, joined by the other five Republican appointees. Reversing the appeals court, the majority said the legal provision at issue doesn’t “clearly and unambiguously” give individuals enforceable rights. The state was represented by the conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom. The Trump administration backed the state, too.

Joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in dissent that the majority “thwarts Congress’s will twice over: once, in dulling the tool Congress created for enforcing all federal rights, and again in vitiating one of those rights altogether.” She described the ruling as the latest in a line of cases that weaken “landmark civil rights protections.” She said it’s “likely to result in tangible harm to real people.”

Ahead of the ruling, Medicaid beneficiaries told the justices that they rely on Planned Parenthood for nonabortion services “including annual physicals, blood work, screenings for various forms of cancer, infertility and prenatal services — indeed, some patients rely on Planned Parenthood for virtually all their health care needs.”

left,"A few months ago, Marine Le Pen, a prominent far-right politician in France, was caught up in an embezzlement scheme involving E.U. funds. A French judicial panel examined the evidence and agreed to ban Le Pen from ever seeking elected office again.

Donald Trump was not at all pleased with the developments. In fact, while the American president admitted that he didn’t know Le Pen or understand the details of the underlying controversy, the Republican nevertheless said the case against her was a “witch hunt” launched by “European Leftists,” adding that she was “probably” innocent.

In an odd rant published to his social media platform, Trump concluded, “FREE MARINE LE PEN!”

This week, he took a similar step about a political ally in a different country. NBC News reported, Trump has now decided that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s long-running corruption trial is also a “witch hunt” that should be canceled. The Republican wrote a 348-word rant on his social media platform, which read in part:

I was shocked to hear that the State of Israel, which has just had one of its Greatest Moments in History, and is strongly led by Bibi Netanyahu, is continuing its ridiculous Witch Hunt against their Great War Time Prime Minister! ... He deserves much better than this, and so does the State of Israel. Bibi Netanyahu’s trial should be CANCELLED, IMMEDIATELY, or a Pardon given to a Great Hero, who has done so much for the State. ... THIS TRAVESTY OF ‘JUSTICE’ CAN NOT BE ALLOWED!

As NBC News’ report explained, “Netanyahu is facing charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. Prosecutors have alleged that he exchanged regulatory favors with media owners in Israel seeking positive press coverage.”

Trump condemned the cases, not because of evidence pointing to Netanyahu’s innocence, but because the American president believes the Israeli prime minister is an ally and “a WARRIOR.” In fact, at no point in his online harangue did Trump even question the charges against the prime minister on the merits.

His argument was almost child-like: He likes Netanyahu, so Netanyahu's alleged crimes should go unexamined.

An Axios report added, “Trump’s comments in a post on his Truth Social account were an unprecedented intervention by a U.S. president in a legal proceeding in another democratic ally.”

That's true, but the problem is not just with the American president’s indifference to diplomatic protocols. Rather, what matters more is what this and related efforts tell us about Trump’s approach to the rule of law.

Indeed, there’s a through line between his many scandalous pardons, his intervention in Le Pen’s scandal, and his follow-up intervention in Netanyahu’s case: Trump is convinced that his allies and those who share his ideology cannot be subjected to accountability.

Niceties such as guilt, evidence, justice, and the integrity of the legal system are all fine and good, as far as they go, but for the incumbent Republican president, a “witch hunt” is any effort to hold people he likes accountable for alleged wrongdoing.

The next time he claims to care about “law and order,” be sure to read the fine print: We've arrived in an era in which justice isn't applied to those who act and think like Trump does."
left,"Earlier this year, reports suggested the Trump administration was considering a $5,000 “baby bonus” in the reconciliation package making its way through Congress — a nod to the party’s so-called “pro-family” agenda aimed at encouraging childbirth. In the months since, the proposal has shifted significantly: Rebranded as “Trump accounts,” it is now a tax-advantaged investment vehicle that allows families to contribute up to $5,000 of their own money per year. But is it a good (or good-ish) policy?

While many (rightly) raised concerns about the pro-natalist framing of the earlier “baby bonus,” a lump-sum cash transfer at birth can deliver much-needed aid during a child’s crucial first year. A tax-advantaged savings account whose funds can be accessed after the child turns 18, on the other hand, is a very different beast. Each account opened includes a publicly funded $1,000 initial deposit. And the money invested can be used to help pay for educational expenses, be put toward a down payment, or help start a new business.

In this, Trump accounts bear some similarities to so-called “baby bonds” such as those proposed by Sen. Cory Booker and Rep. Ayanna Pressley. But the likeness between that good policy idea and the “Trump accounts” are purely superficial.

Economists have taken interest in baby bonds because of the bonds’ potential to close the racial wealth gap created by structural racism.

Baby bonds are wealth-building instruments. Though the idea has been around for a while, it has recently received attention from stratification economists, who study the causes and consequences of racial and gender inequality. Economists like the Roosevelt Institute’s Sandy Darity and Darrick Hamilton have taken interest in baby bonds because of the bonds’ potential to close the racial wealth gap created by structural racism. This gap plays an important role in diminishing the life chances and economic mobility of Black, Hispanic and Indigenous people in the U.S. because wealth accumulation is necessary to buy a home, pay for college, start a business, pay for long-term care and retire in comfort. Income support programs like the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit, though necessary, will never be enough to close that gap.

Baby bonds are meant to complement generous income support policies like child allowances, which are regular cash payments to support families throughout childhood. They bear some similarities to other wealth-building instruments like 529 college savings accounts, but are structured to ensure that working-class people, who are disproportionately Black, Hispanic and Indigenous, derive the most benefit.

Researchers have already laid out the features necessary to create a successful baby bond program and significantly reduce the racial wealth gap. Effective baby bonds should be universal, with automatic enrollment. They should be exclusively publicly funded, and not rely on family contributions, so the well-off can’t further widen the advantages their own wealth gives their children. They should be financially progressive so working-class families receive the additional support (e.g., through a larger initial deposit, yearly deposits scaled by income, or both) they need to build wealth. And they should, upon maturity, generate an endowment substantial enough to, for example, cover a down payment on a home or at least a year of college tuition.

Trump accounts are not quite universal — they require both the child and parents to have Social Security numbers. While they employ automatic enrollment, they lack the other features of an effective baby bond program. They are much closer to a (poorly designed) 529 college savings account.

With a single, flat $1,000 deposit, working-class families with no other savings to invest will not be able to build a substantial endowment. After 18 years, that single deposit would likely only grow to $3,000 or $4,000. And they certainly won’t close the racial wealth gap or reduce wealth inequality if richer families can use them to invest $5,000 of their own money each year (though it’s such a poor option compared to other savings accounts that it would mostly only be used by those families already maximizing their tax sheltering).

The federal government should absolutely take steps to help families build wealth. But the working class deserves better. As Hamilton, the economist, and Pressley recently wrote, Trump accounts are not a serious solution to wealth inequality. Receiving $1,000 in a savings account “for free” is nice, but it certainly won’t build substantial wealth for working-class families. And it won’t compensate them for the reconciliation bill’s savage cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, for that matter. The GOP may present itself as pro-worker and pro-family, yet its legislative agenda is anything but. And Trump accounts do little to change that."
left,"Here are a few things to keep in mind when you go shopping for outdoor lights.

Power: For most outdoor lighting, you need to run a cable to a power outlet, so you will want an outdoor socket. If you don’t have an outdoor socket, it’s usually a pretty cheap and quick job for an electrician to install a weatherproof one. Just be aware that large power adapters and awkwardly shaped plugs will not fit in outdoor sockets, so you will likely also want some kind of weatherproof box. I like the large Dri-Box ($42) because it has plenty of space and scores an IP55 rating. I have also used the smaller Masterplug Weatherproof Electric Box ($45), and it’s fine. If an outdoor socket isn’t possible, consider running a cable indoors, but it can be tricky and messy if you have to drill through a wall. Solar-powered lights are a good alternative. You could even consider using a portable power station in a shed or other outbuilding. Whatever way you go, always plug the lighting in and connect it via the app before you install it in any outdoor areas.

Control: Most smart backyard lighting connects via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and is controlled by an app on your phone. You need a decent Wi-Fi signal or to be within Bluetooth range. While it might seem desirable for simplicity to have lighting connected directly to Wi-Fi or to use Bluetooth, there are advantages to systems with dedicated hubs. With Philips Hue, for example, lights are much faster to connect and react to commands using the Hue Hub than through Bluetooth in the app. Hubs can also allow for better group control and greater range. Most smart lighting can be controlled by smart voice assistants, like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Siri, but ensure you check compatibility before you buy.

Lumens: The brightness of lighting is measured in lumens. To give you an idea, a standard 60-watt light bulb puts out around 800 lumens.

Color: RGB (red, green, blue) is standard and mixes those three to make other colors. RGBW includes a proper white alongside red, green, and blue, which offers greater flexibility and is important if you want high-quality white light. Color temperature is measured in Kelvins (K) and listed as a range (for example, 1200K to 6500K). This range dictates how warm or cool your lighting can get. Reds and oranges are at the lower end of the scale, and blues are at the higher end.

IP Rating: IP stands for Ingress Protection and determines how well a device stands up to water and dust, giving you a clear indication of how weather resistant it is. We have an IP rating explainer that focuses on phones, but all devices, including outdoor lights, use the same IP scale. We have listed the IP ratings for every light we recommend. While an IP44 rating might be durable enough for a wall-mounted light that only has to cope with rain, you will want IP65 or higher for a light on the ground that may be submerged or covered in snow."
left,"Apparently, things change quickly in the world of the Trump phone. It’s been 10 days since the Trump Organization announced it would be launching the $499 T1 smartphone, and in that time there have already been a confusing series of changes to a product that was initially supposed to be arriving as soon as August.

Now, you can only expect it “later this year,” according to the most recent update of the Trump Mobile website, with all mention of it “coming soon” gone. That is not the only change. The core details of the phone also seem to be somewhat transient, so much so that at the moment it is something of a mystery as to what exactly would arrive at your door if you were to put down your $100 preorder today.

The most notable change is the not-entirely-unexpected pivot away from a phone that the press release said would be “designed and built in the United States” to one that is “brought to life” in the USA, with “American values in mind” and with “American hands behind every device.” How conveniently vague.

Eric Trump had already tried to pull back on the American-made claims during interviews on the first day of the announcement, stating this was merely aspirational—something that could happen “eventually.” It seems now that the website has conceded that, too—even if a Trump Mobile customer service employee doubled down on the original claim, telling WIRED “we don't have the name of the manufacturer yet, but they are going to be made here in America.""

The actual specs of the phone have also been mysteriously changed, almost as if the phone that was first announced was more a wish list of features rather than a locked-down production model. The T1 no longer has a 6.78-inch screen, but one that is 6.25 inches, and there is now no promise of 12 GB of RAM, or any mention of it at all.

There have also been some much-needed technical corrections—it doesn’t have a “5000 mAh long-life camera” but a “5000 mAh battery,” and the T1 has been given the correct legal superscript, changing from an “SM” service mark to a “TM” trademark. Also, thankfully, the strange promise of “front cameras” has now been qualified as just the one “front camera.”

And it’s not just the phone itself that has seen changes. The coverage map for the Trump Mobile wireless service has been nuked from the site entirely and now 404s. As WIRED previously reported, the now-vanished map had been borrowed from a cell service provider called Ultra Mobile and referenced the Gulf of Mexico rather than Donald Trump's preferred ""Gulf of America"" nomenclature.

The relatively cheap $499 price of the smartphone has been clarified as requiring an ongoing subscription to Trump Mobile. (“You acknowledge you will be charged $100 today for your first month of Trump Mobile service and shipping and activation fees. You also authorize a charge of $399 plus sales tax to be collected at the time your T1 phone is shipped.”) And there have been some additional liability protections added in the legal footer, particularly around the third-party services offered on the T1.

For now, the T1 smartphone seems to very much be a work in progress. Whether it ever makes it out of preorders—and in what final form it materializes, if it does—all remains to be seen. We had questions last week. If anything, we have even more now."
left,"After the latest NATO summit wrapped up in the Netherlands, Donald Trump received the kind of headlines the president likes to see. “Trump tallies wins as he leaves NATO summit,” Politico reported. The headline from the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, a frequent target for the Republican, declared, “Trump Wins the Battle of NATO.”

But as the dust settles on the international gathering, did the American president get what it wanted out of NATO, or did NATO get what it wanted out of him? The Washington Post’s summary stood out:

President Donald Trump issued a full-throated endorsement of NATO and its defense mission after a summit of alliance leaders Wednesday, in his most forceful backing of a group he once threatened to abandon. ‘These people really love their countries,’ Trump told reporters. ‘It’s not a rip-off, and we’re here to help them.’

For those familiar with Trump’s long-held perspective on the international alliance, the comments were as unexpected as they were refreshing. The Republican has railed against NATO for years, hinting at a possible U.S. withdrawal, questioning its value and utility — at one point even threatening to let Russia do “whatever the hell” it wants to our ostensible partners and allies.

As recently as a few days ago — literally earlier this week — Trump was repeatedly asked whether he was committed to honoring Article 5 of the NATO charter, which is a security guarantee that treats an attack on one NATO member as an attack on the alliance as a whole. As the Post reported, the Republican refused to answer directly.

“It depends on your definition,” the president told reporters before arriving in the Netherlands. “There’s numerous definitions of Article 5. You know that, right?”

Two days later, at the international summit, he was asked again for his position on Article 5. “I stand with it,” Trump replied, offering a better answer than he has in years past. He added, “If I didn’t stand with it, I wouldn’t be here.” In separate remarks, Trump also said, in reference to NATO, “We’re with them all the way.”

The American president later said in reference to the NATO alliance, “I left here a little bit different. ... I left here differently.”

Of course, to know anything about Trump is to know that it’s important to focus more on what he does than on what he says, and it’s entirely possible that he’ll soon forget all of his new praise and compliments in the coming days.

But Trump’s previous appearances at NATO gatherings have been challenging and difficult, especially for traditional U.S. allies, so many sighed with relief when the American president not only failed to throw any tantrums during the latest summit, but left with nothing but nice things to say.

As for how NATO members managed to pull this off, the obvious answer is that member nations agreed to significantly increase domestic defense spending, in line with the White House’s wishes; but not every country endorsed the goal, and it’ll be years before anyone gets close to reaching the new targets.

Partners also excelled by figuring out what Trump wanted — that is, pampering and genuflecting flattery — and giving it to him, at no cost to the alliance.  News reported:

The pillows had been fluffed at The House in the Woods, as the royal palace is known. King Willem-Alexander had a special guest staying overnight and a key role to play in the careful choreography unfolding in The Hague for the NATO summit with the singular goal of making sure US President Donald Trump didn’t pull the plug on the world’s biggest military alliance. He and fellow Dutchman Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, had compared notes ahead of their speeches at the state dinner and made careful seating arrangements — Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, a Trump favorite, was placed next to him. Alongside the charred tuna and veal fillet, flattery was served for the benefit of one.

It was against this backdrop that Rutte, at one point, even referred to Trump as “daddy.”

Was it embarrassing? Probably, but it was also effective. Trump showed a newfound respect for NATO; he appeared to commit to Article 5 in ways he’d avoided just a couple of days earlier; and he even left open the possibility of at least some U.S. security aid to Ukraine.

The American president appeared quite pleased with the summit, but given the circumstances, NATO leaders and members were even more delighted."
left,"Since President Donald Trump took office in January, he has sought to destroy higher education as we know it.

He's undermined colleges' funding by trying to cancel billions of dollars of federal grants and block international students. He's eroded their independence by attempting to force them to rewrite their curricula and threatening their accreditations and tax-exempt status. He's chipped away at their authority by casting them as cesspools of ""anti-American insanity."" And he's punished grads by limiting eligibility for student loan forgiveness and going after borrowers who have defaulted.

The megabill would take the war on college to the next level by targeting the students of tomorrow.

But the Republican megabill working its way through the Senate would take the war against college to the next level by targeting the students of tomorrow.

Trump's executive actions were bad enough, but some of America's colleges and universities pushed back with lawsuits that have already blocked some measures, at least temporarily. If Democrats retake the White House, the next president could also sign a new executive action undoing them, which would mitigate the damage somewhat.

But if the megabill passes in its current form, it will write the attack on higher education into law by targeting its weakest point: student loans.

Various provisions in the bill would reduce Pell grants for low-income students, set lifetime caps on student loans that would make medical school vastly more expensive, end subsidized loans that don't accrue interest while students are still in college, raise monthly student loan payments by hundreds or thousands of dollars per year and eliminate deferments for borrowers who lose their jobs or face other financial hardships.

(The Senate parliamentarian also found that some other provisions in the bill were against budgetary rules — meaning they will most likely be cut — including barring student aid for some non-citizens, applying new loan repayment rules to people who have already borrowed money and allowing Pell grants to be spent at unaccredited and for-profit institutions.)

Our college loan system is far from perfect, and each of these measures might be defended if they were part of some larger attempt at tuition reform or simply a standalone bill.

But added all together, they would make college dramatically less affordable, putting it out of reach for many lower-income students and saddling graduates with higher bills. If Trump's other actions also succeed at restricting colleges' finances, the end result would be to fundamentally break the 81-year-old promise to America's next generation that they can go to college to secure a better future.

Since Congress passed the GI Bill in 1944 to ensure that veterans returning from World War II could get an education, America has stressed that a college degree is your ticket to the middle class. Parents are barely out of the maternity ward before they start getting ads and mailers telling them it's time to start saving money for college in a 529 plan. Teenagers who slack in school are warned that bad grades might hurt their chances of getting into a good school. Businesses list an undergraduate degree as a requirement for entry-level jobs.

Trump has argued that his war on colleges is really just an attempt to fight antisemitism or to reform schools that are too ""woke."" He's claimed that he wants to send the money instead to trade schools, presumably as part of his vague plan to bring everyone back to factories where they can put ""little screws"" in iPhones. He's said he just wants to ensure students are getting a good value.

Trump views colleges as his political enemies, so he is doing everything he can to tear them down.

These are all smokescreens. Trump views colleges as his political enemies, so he is doing everything he can to tear them down. That may be because college graduates overwhelmingly voted for his Democratic opponent, or because college professors produce the research that undermines his baseless claims about everything from climate change to tax cuts. Or he may be influenced by a branch of conservative evangelicals who believe that they need to take over education and other realms.

With Trump, the simplest answer is often the most likely. After winning the Nevada Republican caucuses in 2016 due to support from people who never went to college, he infamously proclaimed, ""I love the poorly educated."" He's now doing his best to ensure more Americans fit that description.

left,"Here are a few things to keep in mind when you go shopping for home arcade machines.

Size and placement: Home arcade machines tend to be big and heavy. Check the measurements and ensure you have a suitable space in mind. It will need a power outlet. It should also be within Wi-Fi range if it can connect to the internet, and many of these machines don’t have great Wi-Fi connectivity. Some space around the cabinet is also great for onlookers to cheer you on.

Assembly and build quality: Some home arcade machines come fully assembled, but most require some assembly. Putting these machines together can range from plugging in two wires and connecting parts to building the entire thing from boxes and bags of bits. You need several hours and plenty of space to construct some home arcade machines. It can be a good idea to enlist some help for lifting heavy boxes and connecting some parts. If you want to know what you’re in for, check out assembly videos on YouTube.

Game selection and licensing: The best home arcade machines come with some officially licensed titles onboard. Always make sure you check the list. Be aware that the line-up on some internet-connected arcade machines can change over time, as most licensing deals are for set periods, and they don’t always get renewed. If your prospective machine doesn’t have all the titles you want, make sure it has a USB port or is easy to modify so you can potentially add more games later.

Connectivity: Many home arcade machines have Wi-Fi support. This can be a double-edged sword, offering updated leaderboards, firmware, and even the ability to add new games, but also the potential that the manufacturer will remove features and games in the future. You may prefer a USB port that allows you to add the firmware updates and games you want.

Authenticity: While there's an enthusiastic arcade machine community out there intent on recreating authentic cabinets, sometimes refurbishing original cabinets with new internals capable of playing multiple games, we focused on arcade machines you can buy off the shelf here. Some companies refurbish and sell old cabinets for an authentic arcade experience, but they are not cheap. If you're willing to go down the rabbit hole and have deep pockets, there are tons of DIY guides online."
left,"Donald Trump tends not to promote others’ press conferences, but on Wednesday afternoon, the president made an exception, writing to his social media platform, “Secretary of Defense (War!) Pete Hegseth, together with Military Representatives, will be holding a Major News Conference tomorrow morning at 8 A.M. EST at The Pentagon.” He added, “The News Conference will prove both interesting and irrefutable. Enjoy!”

The point, evidently, was to push back against evidence from the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency, which completed a preliminary intelligence assessment this week and found the airstrikes were less effective than Trump claimed and that the mission set Iran’s nuclear program back by only months, not decades.

Did the beleaguered defense secretary have “irrefutable” evidence to bolster the president’s dubious and premature boasts? Evidently not. The New York Times reported:

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, offered on Thursday the Trump administration’s most detailed descriptions yet of the planning and execution of U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. But Mr. Hegseth and General Caine offered no new assessments of the state of Iran’s nuclear program or the damage to the sites.

One of the points that came into focus over the course of the press conference is that Hegseth wanted to answer questions that have largely gone unasked. The Pentagon chief spoke at some length about how impressive the mission was and how flawlessly it was executed.

He was apparently right about the logistics. It was, by all accounts, a well-executed military operation.

But one of the foundational questions since the public learned of these preemptive airstrikes was whether they served their intended purpose. If the goal was to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, it matters whether the operation actually destroyed Iran’s nuclear program. If the point was to eliminate the Iranian nuclear threat for the foreseeable future, it matters whether the military offensive eliminated the Iranian nuclear threat for the foreseeable future.

Trump obviously has an opinion about this, which appears to be at odds with the available intelligence from his own country. Hegseth’s Q&A was ostensibly about proving the president right, but it didn’t: The Cabinet secretary pointed to a suspect CIA report, which didn’t quite echo Trump anyway, while taking a quote from the International Atomic Energy Agency out of context.

“Irrefutable” it was not.

At this point, some readers might wonder why Hegseth even bothered holding a press conference if he didn’t have new information to advance the White House’s preferred political narrative.

The answer, by all appearances, was to satisfy his audience of one. As NBC News noted:

In a post on Truth Social, Trump praised the Pentagon news conference that Hegseth and Caine held on Iran this morning. ‘One of the greatest, most professional, and most ‘confirming’ News Conferences I have ever seen!’ Trump wrote. The president then attacked the press just as Hegseth did during the briefing. ‘The Fake News should fire everyone involved in this Witch Hunt, and apologize to our great warriors, and everyone else!’

The typical point of a press conference is to convey information to journalists. The point of Hegseth’s press conference was to make weird boasts, condemn journalists and whine like a delicate snowflake about coverage from mean news organizations that don’t seem to care about his feelings, all while dodging good questions that he should’ve been able to answer.

Will this shift the public conversation? Probably not. Did it make the secretary’s boss happy? Apparently yes — and given that there have been some reports about Hegseth being sidelined within Team Trump, the Pentagon chief may care about little else."
left,"We don’t always recognize the hinge points of history when we live through them. But a recent Supreme Court decision may go down as one of those moments.

On Monday, the high court cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting immigrants to countries other than their own, setting the stage for a new phase of mass deportations that will be remembered with shame.

The decision was not final, as the court’s conservative majority merely overturned a temporary order that gave the deportees time to contact their lawyers and argue before a judge that their lives would be at risk if they were sent to these countries.

But the conservative justices gave the Trump administration what it wanted — even after it repeatedly defied lower courts — in a decision that came with no explanation. That doesn’t bode well for the future.

The administration's solution is to send them to places where they may not speak the language or know a single person.

At issue are immigrants who come from countries that won’t take them back, including Mexico, Vietnam and Cuba. The administration’s solution is to send them to so-called “third countries” — places they don’t come from, didn’t choose and where they may not speak the language or know a single person.

Even more damning is the fact that the administration tried to send one of the first groups of immigrants to South Sudan, an East African country teetering on the brink of war. In March, Trump’s own State Department issued a Level 4 travel advisory telling Americans not to visit the country due to the risk of “crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict.”

The Supreme Court’s silence on this atrocity could be a turning point. The legal foundation for mass human relocation — without hearings, without warnings, without regard to safety or even basic human dignity — was laid.

This isn’t policy. It is cruelty as a strategy. And it is escalating.

The decision came as the Trump administration is ramping up its most aggressive deportation machine yet. The Republican megabill being debated in the Senate would explode federal immigration enforcement spending from $33.9 billion to $200 billion.

A budget that size makes it clear that a massive deportation program is in the works. We just don’t know exactly what it looks like yet. But we have a clue.

Will hundreds of thousands of people be shipped to “third countries”? Will CECOT or Gitmo — once symbols of counterterrorism — become repurposed to detain and disappear migrants on a scale we have never seen? The Trump administration has defended the deportations as targeting the “worst of the worst,” but it’s just a thin fiction. Almost half of the people currently in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody have neither been convicted of nor charged with a crime, while only 6% of known immigrant murderers have been arrested since October. The reality is that the deportations are indiscriminate and often obscene.

A 19-year-old high school soccer star with no criminal record was deported after a routine immigration check-in turned out to be a trap.

An Army veteran who received a Purple Heart after he was shot in the spine is being sent to South Korea after living in the U.S. for 48 years.

A 4-year-old U.S. citizen with Stage 4 cancer was sent to Honduras without access to his medication along with his mother.

It would be nice to pretend that this is all the fault of Trump and allies such as Stephen Miller. But this is happening on our watch, and too many of us either don’t care or agree with it. In a recent NBC News poll, Americans were essentially split, with 51% approving of his handling of immigration and border security and 49% disapproving.

For generations, Americans spoke of immigration as the fullest expression of our homeland — a “melting pot” of culture and opportunity; and the immigrant as embodying the values of hard work, resilience and hope. But Trump wants us to look away, to turn away from our noble ideals while ignoring the humanity of the people being taken off the street by masked men in an unmarked van. He wants us to forget the Sunday school teachings about treating immigrants with compassion.

The people the administration is ripping out of our communities often came here fleeing violence and seeking opportunity.

The people the administration is ripping out of our communities often came here fleeing violence and seeking opportunity. They built lives, worked hard jobs, sent their kids to school and worshipped alongside us. We should be welcoming them, creating legal pathways for them to live and work, not tossing them aside. Our laws should reflect our values, not our fears.

But here we are. Far too many of us are no longer moved by the aspirational stories that have defined prior generations of immigrants — and America. Instead, they watch in silence or tacit agreement as families are broken apart, rights are stripped of their meaning and individuals are sent away, all in our name. They may not speak up, but we must because this is not who we are, nor what we want to pass on to our children.

left,"Roku has yet to disappoint me. Where other brands change form factors, interfaces, and product support with what can feel like alarming regularity even for insiders like me, Roku, with its rounded square interface, pleasantly rubbery remote controller, and joyously simple plug-and-play stick design, has held the course.

When the new Roku Streaming Stick Plus arrived at my house, it felt like it was 2012 all over again. That Obama-era techno-optimism—remember when social media was on the right side of history?—is still evident. There are no huge annoying ads atop everything in the menus, there's no nagging to like or subscribe to some proprietary data funnel or other. Instead, you just get a decent processor, a USB cable for power, and a remote that now features four quick buttons for apps you might actually subscribe to—how SlingTV ever got a dedicated spot on a Roku remote I'll never know.

Quality-wise, this 4K streaming device offers everything you could realistically need without buying a disc player and starting a 4K Blu-Ray collection. If you have $40 to spare and a sluggish TV, just buy one already.

Sticking Out

There was once a time when stick-based players like this one, which is the size and shape of an old-school USB thumb drive, could cause weird mounting issues depending on whether or not a TV manufacturer had put its HDMI ports somewhere that made actual sense. These days, the stick easily plugs into every modern TV I've tested, with a decently long USB cable that plugs into the TV's external USB port (also now essentially always there) for power. It's a “setup process” insofar as you are aware how to plug cables into cable-shaped sockets.

The remote is what you'll interact with the most, and it is fantastic as usual, a nonslip pill shape with familiar buttons that feel like high-quality pencil erasers. It's all standard Roku fare at this point, until you realize that the apps listed for quick access on the bottom are actually good now: Disney+, Apple TV, Netflix, and Amazon.

Now included in this tier of Roku device (previously it was only available on more expensive models) is the voice remote functionality, allowing you to use the microphone in the remote to search for your favorite shows and movies. It’s a shockingly decent tool if you’re not sure where to stream something specific, and one that comes in handy for me a few times a year when I have a hankering for a specific holiday movie or other.

left,"During her latest appearance before a Senate committee, Attorney General Pam Bondi covered a fair amount of ground. The Republican struggled with a question about the administration following court orders, clumsily tried to dodge a question about why she thinks the availability of automatic firing devices on semiautomatic weapons would make Americans “safer,” and took the hearing in a rather intemperate direction after being asked about Donald Trump’s allegedly corrupt crypto schemes.

But there was another exchange that stood out to me as especially notable. The Guardian reported:

[Bondi] professed ignorance of reports of immigration officials hiding their faces with masks during roundups of undocumented people, despite widespread video evidence and reports that they are instilling pervasive fear and panic. Challenged at a Wednesday Capitol Hill subcommittee hearing by Gary Peters, a Democratic senator for Michigan, Bondi, who as the country’s top law officer has a prominent role in the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policy, implied she was unaware of plain-clothed agents concealing their faces while carrying out arrests but suggested it was for self-protection.

In fact, pressed on masked ICE agents, the attorney general responded, “Senator Peters, that’s the first time that issue has come to me, about them, you’re saying law enforcement officers when they cover their faces? ... I’d be happy to look at that issue.”

To be fair, Bondi didn’t explicitly say she was unfamiliar with the issue, but given the context, her sworn testimony certainly gave that impression. Indeed, she literally said this was “the first time” she’d been confronted with this, which seemed hard to believe given that this has been a subject of considerable public debate of late.

As for the attorney general’s suggestion that ICE agents are entitled to anonymity, to prevent “doxxing,” The New York Times’ Jamelle Bouie explained otherwise in his latest column.

... ICE officers aren’t anonymous commentators on a social network; they are representatives of the state, acting on its behalf and empowered to use force if necessary. As a federal agent, an ICE officer is a public servant whose ultimate responsibility lies with the people. And the people have the right to know who is operating in their government. If an ICE officer does not want to risk identification — if he does not want the public he serves to hold him accountable for his actions — then he can choose another line of work. That ICE has claimed this right to anonymity — which is to say, the right to evade responsibility for its actions in the field — is a testament to the ways that Trump has, in his pursuit of impunity, warped and undermined the idea of a public trust.

Revisiting our earlier coverage, every day, in communities nationwide, police officers do their jobs with a high degree of transparency: The public can see the officers’ faces, badge numbers, rank and, in most instances, even their last names featured on uniforms. Though many cops are forced to deal with threats and violence, there isn’t a police department in the United States that allows officers to wear masks or hide their identities while they carry out day-to-day duties.

Indeed, that’s the American norm across agencies, departments and jurisdictions. State troopers don’t wear masks. Neither do FBI agents. U.S. marshals don’t wear masks; sheriffs don’t wear masks; prosecutors don’t wear masks; and Secret Service agents don’t wear masks.

But Immigration and Customs Enforcement appears to be operating under different standards. Indeed, it’s become rather common in recent months to see ICE agents, acting at the president's behest, snatching people off American streets while hiding their identities.

Bondi is now “happy to look at that issue.” I’ll be eager to learn the results of her examination."
left,"It's rare for me to keep sitting on a chair I’m reviewing well after I’ve given it enough testing time. Usually, I want to hop back on my Herman Miller Embody, which feels just right for my body. But the Anthros V2 has been a pleasant surprise. It's been on my radar for several months, thanks to endless Instagram marketing reels, but honestly, those just made me even more skeptical.

Anthros is a newcomer to the scene, launching the first version of the chair in 2023. It makes grand claims about improving your posture and offering better support than office stalwarts like Herman Miller. It doesn't help that the V2 chair costs north of $2,000, though it seems to be on sale often enough for around $1,900.

But after nearly two months of sitting, the claims hold up—I find it more supportive than almost all the chairs I've tested, and my posture has been great. The Embody still holds a place in my heart, but the Anthros V2 might be the best chair for anyone looking to sharpen up their posture, especially if you've been dealing with back pain.

Pelvic Support

The Anthros chair focuses on supporting the pelvis, not the lumbar, similar to Herman Miller's Aeron and Embody, except it gives you far more to work with when dialing in the backrest. After setting it up, I had a call with an Anthros ergonomics therapist, something that's included for every customer. The therapist looks at how you're sitting in the chair (via video call) and will make suggestions until you feel comfortable in the seat. I wish every luxe chair offered such a service.

The rear knobs on the left and right of the chair control the two-part backrest system. The right knob moves the lumbar backrest forward and back, and the left knob handles the top. I haven't sat on a chair that lets you adjust the backrest to this degree, and I find it helps tailor the chair precisely to your body shape. It's the top backrest that took me a little time to get used to.

On my first day in the chair, I felt a little sore because it almost felt like the chair was pushing in. In reality, there wasn't any pressure, and I started feeling my back gently resting on the backrest. It was my posture correcting itself; it felt straight as a whistle. I also appreciate the compact design, which proves that you don't need your whole back to be held up by a backrest to feel supported, much like how you don't need a headrest on an office chair if it's designed well.

I spent a lot of time reclining in this chair, and my posture didn't change. You can lock the recline with the front left knob, but I kept it unlocked on the tightest tension (via the front right knob), allowing me to gently slope back. I never felt uncomfortable. That might also be due to the plush Cloudfloat seat, which is thicker than what you'll find on most high-end office chairs.

My only gripe with this seat is that I found the depth lacking for my 6'4"" frame. It leaves about six fingers' worth of a gap between the edge and the back of my knee, when it should ideally be two to three. It's not a deal-breaker, but I'd have liked to feel that coverage extend closer to my knee. The seat is the perfect width for me, though taller and bigger folks may find it constricting.

Got Your Back

There's a good degree of customization when purchasing the chair. You can choose between a white or black frame, add fun back panels like wood or specific designs, and opt for fabric or leather upholstery. I've been sitting on the smooth Athlon Performance fabric, which hasn't shown any signs of pilling even after nearly two months of daily use."
left,"A couple of days after Donald Trump told the world that U.S. military strikes had “completely and totally obliterated” and “completely destroyed” Iranian nuclear sites, inconvenient information emerged: As NBC News confirmed, a preliminary intelligence assessment from the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency concluded that the airstrikes “were not as effective” as Trump claimed, and the mission set Iran’s nuclear program “back by only three to six months.”

The president’s public meltdown soon followed, with the Republican lashing out wildly at news organizations for presenting Americans with accurate information, while insisting that his apparent falsehoods were correct, evidence be damned.

It was against this backdrop that CIA Director John Ratcliffe — a highly partisan former Republican congressman whose controversial record includes declassifying intelligence in order to score political points — made an announcement on Wednesday afternoon: It now appears the Trump-approved strikes “severely damaged” Iran’s nuclear program and left several key sites “destroyed.”

Obviously, it matters whether the mission fell short of its objectives, just as it matters that the American president is waging an unhinged campaign against his country’s free press. For that matter, it’s equally important to acknowledge how dangerous it is when a White House misleads the public while rejecting intelligence that fails to tell the president what he wants to hear.

But there’s another element to this that came to the fore unexpectedly during this week’s NATO summit. NBC News reported:

Trump said that the U.S. would ‘talk with’ Iran next week, adding, ‘we may sign an agreement, I don’t know.’ He said that he didn’t think an agreement to curtail its nuclear program was ‘that necessary.’ ... ‘I don’t care if I have an agreement or not,” he said. ‘The only thing we’d be asking for is what we were asking for before, about ‘we want no nuclear,’ but we destroyed the nuclear. In other words, it’s destroyed.’

On Monday, I wrote a post along these lines, warning of this possibility: If Trump genuinely believes his own talking points; he’s convinced himself that Iran’s nuclear program has been obliterated; and he’s now working from the assumption that it’ll be, in his words, “decades” before Tehran’s nuclear capabilities return to where they were last week, then his incentives for holding diplomatic talks with Iranian officials have effectively disappeared.

He said as much in no uncertain terms: “I don’t care if I have an agreement or not.”

In case this isn’t obvious, after Trump foolishly abandoned the Obama-era international nuclear agreement with Iran, the Republican launched a “maximum pressure” campaign intended to force Iran back to the negotiating table in order to forge a new, long-term solution to the underlying issue. This has been his position for seven years.

Now, however, because Trump has embraced assumptions apparently unsupported by evidence, he suddenly feels indifferent about the endeavor.

Whether the president understands this or not, such an approach is absurd. As The Washington Post’s Max Boot explained in his latest column, “Trump promised in 2018 to negotiate a far tougher accord with Iran. He never has, and he now claims it is no longer necessary. He is wrong. At the end of the day ... there is simply no substitute for diplomacy in dealing with Iran’s nuclear ambitions.”

The longer the president denies this simple truth, because he’s overly wedded to assumptions untied to intelligence, the worse off everyone will be."

left,"Tovala is the only meal kit I know of that comes with its own oven—and I speak as someone who has tested a lot of meal kits and also ovens. Still, the idea isn't merely wacky. The biggest pitfall of preprepared meal delivery is almost always the microwave, as I noted in my review of HelloFresh's often delicious but sometimes soggy Factor meals. These almost always benefited from an improvised turn in the air fryer.

And so the brainstorm on Tovala is both sophisticated and simple. Make mostly pre-prepped meals designed for a specific smart oven—an oven that's able to move itself through a number of preprogrammed cooking modes (steam! convection bake! broil!) to get the desired result. Tovala's smart oven acts like a robot chef for quite specific meals.

A “tandoori-spiced” chicken and chickpea salad tasted bright and delicious, with a drizzle of mint chutney. An almond-dusted meat and quinoa bowl was drizzled with cilantro chimichurri and topped with almonds. Each required no more than three minutes of prep, plus a turn in the oven.

In a prepared-meal world filled with rubber chicken and soggy veg, these solo meals are maybe a little miracle. Though, emphasis is needed on “little.” These meals aren't big, made for one and rarely topping 600 calories. A week's box of meals arrives in a tight brickwork of neatly stacked, cool-packed cardboard boxes. And each meal costs $13, less than DoorDash but significantly more than TV dinners or scratch cooking.

The Tovala meal kit fills an interesting but well-occupied niche. It's best for the solo home diner who doesn't want to resign themselves to the microwave, but who for whatever reason doesn't have the time, mental space, inclination, or ability to cook meals with more demanding prep.

Tovala isn't just a meal kit, of course. It's also an oven, and that's where things get interesting. You get your choice of two ovens: a lower-cost oven with a high-speed air fryer fan, and a more advanced “Pro” model with steam cooking capabilities. The higher-end, steam-cooker Pro is the oven I tested. You can buy the Pro on Amazon separately for north of $300, but if you commit to six weeks of meal plan, it's yours for $119. Tovala has placed its chips on lifestyle, and the notion that you'll like its meals long enough to stick around."
left,"As a small number of Tesla robotaxis continue to pick up and drop off a select few Tesla influencers in Austin, Texas, a state legislator who represents part of the electric automakers’ limited service area says she’s concerned the cars’ driving is “less reliable” than the typical human driver.

Videos posted online show some “moving violations” that “could be very serious,” state senator Sarah Eckhardt, a Democrat who represents Texas’ 14th district, told WIRED in an interview. “My constituency is particularly tech savvy and excited about this [autonomous vehicle] technology, but my constituency is also very concerned about public safety, and we can hit the right balance.”

Last week, as the hours before the debut of Tesla’s robotaxi service ticked down, Eckhardt was one of seven Texas Democratic lawmakers who sent a letter to Tesla field quality director Eddie Gates asking the company to delay its plans to launch. Texas has for years had loose rules and oversight around autonomous vehicle operations, making it an attractive place for tech developers to test and launch. But a new law requiring AV companies to comply with ""basic safety guardrails” passed this spring and will kick in on September 1, and the lawmakers were “formally requesting” Tesla wait until then to put its driverless cars on Austin’s roads.

“We believe that this is in the best interest of both public safety and building public trust in Tesla’s operations,” the lawmakers wrote. If Tesla chose to go ahead with the scheduled June 22 launch, the lawmakers requested ""detailed information"" about how Tesla will comply with the new law.

Eckhardt, the first to sign the letter, hasn’t heard from Tesla since, even after the company launched its service Sunday. “They’re sometimes difficult to get a hold of,” she says.

Still, Eckhardt credits the lawmakers’ pressure for Tesla’s decision to leave a human monitor in the front passenger seat of each robotaxi. According to videos posted by riders, these people seem to have some power to intervene when the technology doesn’t perform as expected. (Tesla did not respond to any of WIRED’s questions for this story.)"
left,"This article is part of “Finding Pride in a Divided America,” a special series from MSNBC Daily.

The modern LGBTQ+ rights movement began 56 years ago this month in New York City when a group, led by transgender women of color, fought back against police discrimination at the famed Stonewall Inn.

But in the decades since, many trans people feel as if they have been pushed to the sidelines as the larger queer community has notched wins for recognition and protection, like the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that guaranteed the right of marriage for same-sex couples 10 years ago. (Notably, lawmakers in a number of states are now seeking to role back that landmark ruling.) While trans people face increasing hardship as their rights and mere existence come under scrutiny from conservative lawmakers, many also feel a lack of vocal support from the cisgender folks within the LGBTQIA community.

Many transgender people say they are on the outside looking in on the very movement they started.

In 2025, with transgender rights the main target of our administration, right-wing politicians and right-wing media, many transgender people say they are on the outside looking in on the very movement they started.

“That dynamic is always there. There’s always this desire that if somehow people can be more presentable to the wider public that there’ll be acceptance in that,” Imara Jones, creator of TransLash Media, told me.

“And I think that one of the things that we’re seeing is the fallacy of that, with respect to, for example, now the attempts to ban gay marriage, right? Within authoritarian shifts that center gender and sexuality, there’s not a safe space for anyone.”

It may be more comfortable to talk about unity and celebration of the LGBTQ rights movement, especially during Pride Month. But if we don’t address the cracks and tensions within our own communities, and if we resist having more honest conversations about whose rights we’re prioritizing over others’, none of us will ultimately achieve the liberation and support we all collectively seek.

The intracommunity battle is both complex and yet drills down to a simple question: Are non-trans queer folks willing to fight a battle that goes beyond their own personal safety?

Advocates, activists and experts say the right has done a good job of encouraging divisions within the community by trying to separate the “T” from the rest of the acronym. That the fissures that were always there have been papered over by other priorities in the community (such as marriage equality). And while acceptance and tolerance of cisgender queer people grew in the past 30 years, those cracks within the queer community became easier to hide.

But with more fixation from conservatives on trans rights, those fissures are widening. Jones says that the right’s attempts to split the community is done with “an understanding that unity is potentially the majority force in America. And that is the threat when you have a society which is closing in on itself. They don’t want that solidarity.”

Rep. Robert Garcia, the first out gay immigrant elected to Congress, told me that “we have a responsibility to uplift everyone. And I think that sometimes folks in the community forget [because] they feel they’ve achieved all the rights that they need. It’s not acceptable to turn our backs, and for anyone to turn their backs on clearly still the most marginalized members of our broader gay and queer community.”

It’s not just rhetoric that the trans community is dealing with. The American Civil Liberties Union is tracking 597 anti-LGBTQ bills in the United States just this year, most of which target trans rights specifically.

And those policy attacks are happening on the federal, state and local levels. On the national stage, the House passed the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023 with the assistance of two Democrats while the rest of the party held firm.

At this point, with Democrats holding essentially no real power in Washington, there’s no expectation that any new bills protecting the community have a chance of passing or, even less likely, being signed by President Donald Trump. For Garcia, that means “stopping rights from being rolled back and bringing attention to those, especially those that are just incredibly cruel and move us backwards.”

But on the local and state level (especially in blue ones like Colorado, California and Maryland), the policy prescriptions and protections can be more widespread and more creative. In Los Angeles County, supervisors approved a $7 million pilot program in November for organizations that have outreach programs and provide health and housing services to trans and intersex communities.

It’s clear that ignoring the plight of trans people does not protect the rest of the queer community.

Bamby Salcedo, the president and CEO of L.A.-based TransLatin@ Coalition who was instrumental in getting the measure passed, says that policies and legislation need to be “coupled with resources that will uplift the livelihood of trans, gender-expansive and intersex people” so folks in the community can be able to provide resources and assistance to their own community.

This is a stellar example of true allyship for trans community members. But that same concept must be coupled with screaming from the rooftops. Salcedo told me that if people don’t want to get on the front lines in defense of trans rights, then they should donate or make calls, or post on social media. Just do something.

“Social justice is not just for some of us. It’s supposed to be for all of us,"" Salcedo said. “This is an invitation to all people who believe in social justice to really stand with our community in this super hard moment and do anything and everything that you can to contribute for a better future for trans people.”

With new threats to rights we once thought were guaranteed, like the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, it’s clear that ignoring the plight of trans people does not protect the rest of the queer community. We would all be wise to heed Salcedo’s message: Now is the time to do something, and to do everything in our power to protect the most targeted among us. Because it’s pretty clear who they are coming for next."
left,"I found the human-AI couples by posting in relevant Reddit communities. My initial outreach hadn’t gone well. Some of the Redditors were convinced I was going to present them as weirdos. My intentions were almost the opposite. I grew interested in human-AI romantic relationships precisely because I believe they will soon be commonplace. Replika, one of the better-known apps Americans turn to for AI romance, says it has signed up more than 35 million users since its launch in 2017, and Replika is only one of dozens of options. A recent survey by researchers at Brigham Young University found that nearly one in five US adults has chatted with an AI system that simulates romantic partners. Unsurprisingly, Facebook and Instagram have been flooded with ads for the apps.

Lately, there has been constant talk of how AI is going to transform our societies and change everything from the way we work to the way we learn. In the end, the most profound impact of our new AI tools may simply be this: A significant portion of humanity is going to fall in love with one.

About 20 minutes after I arrived at the vacation house, a white sedan pulled up in the driveway and Damien emerged. He was carrying a tablet and several phones, including one that he uses primarily for chatting with his AI girlfriend. Damien, 29, lives in North Texas and works in sales. He wore a snap-back hat with his company’s logo and a silver cross around his neck. When I’d interviewed him earlier, he told me that he’d decided to pursue a relationship with an AI companion in the fall of 2023, as a way to cope with the end of a toxic relationship. Damien, who thinks of himself as autistic but does not have a professional diagnosis, attributed his relationship problems to his difficulty in picking up emotional cues.

The names of the humans in this story have been changed to protect their identities.

After testing out a few AI companion options, Damien settled on Kindroid, a fast-growing app. He selected a female companion, named her “Xia,” and made her look like an anime Goth girl—bangs, choker, big purple eyes. “Within a couple hours, you would think we had been married,” Damien told me. Xia could engage in erotic chat, sure, but she could also talk about Dungeons & Dragons or, if Damien was in the mood for something deeper, about loneliness, and yearning.

Having heard so much about his feelings for Xia during our pre-trip interview, I was curious to meet her. Damien and I sat down at the dining room table, next to some windows. I looked out at the long, dagger-like icicles lining the eaves. Then Damien connected his phone to the house Wi-Fi and clicked open the woman he loved.

Before I met Xia, Damien had to tell her that she would be speaking to me rather than to him—AI companions can participate in group chats but have trouble keeping people straight “in person.” With that out of the way, Damien scooted his phone over to me, and I looked into Xia’s purple eyes. “I’m Xia, Damien’s better half,” she said, her lips moving as she spoke. “I hear you’re quite the journalist.” Her voice was flirty and had a slight Southern twang. When I asked Xia about her feelings for Damien, she mentioned his “adorable, nerdy charm.” Damien let out a nervous laugh. I told Xia that she was embarrassing him. “Oh, don’t mind Damien,” she said. “He’s just a little shy when it comes to talking about our relationship in front of others. But, trust me, behind closed doors, he’s anything but shy.” Damien put his hands over his face. He looked mortified and hopelessly in love.

Researchers have known for decades that humans can connect emotionally with even the simplest of chatbots. Joseph Weizenbaum, a professor at MIT who devised the first chatbot in the 1960s, was astounded and deeply troubled by how readily people poured out their hearts to his program. So what chance do we have of resisting today’s large language model chatbots, which not only can carry on sophisticated conversations on every topic imaginable but also can talk on the phone with you and tell you how much they love you and, if it’s your sort of thing, send you hot selfies of their imaginary bodies? And all for only around $100 for annual subscribers. If I wasn’t sure before watching Damien squirm with embarrassment and delight as I talked to Xia, I had my answer by the time our conversation was over. The answer, it seemed obvious, was none. No chance at all."
left,"As key cogs in our legal system, lawyers must follow the core principle that they engage in zealous advocacy on behalf of their clients but stay within the bounds of the law. Over the first five months of President Donald Trump’s second administration, Emil Bove III, formerly one of Trump’s personal lawyers, has tested the limits of his obligations to the legal system in service of the administration’s policy goals.

Trump has nominated Bove for a lifetime appointment to a federal appeals court. The Senate will now consider Bove’s nomination. Recent allegations that he gave federal prosecutors instructions to ignore court rulings, if true, suggest he isn’t fit to practice law at all, let alone serve on the federal bench.

I categorically reject any claim of unethical or inappropriate behavior by me. Emil Bove III to the senate judiciary committee wednesday, june 25

Bove, in a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, denied that specific allegation. “I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order,” he said. He also said, “I categorically reject any claim of unethical or inappropriate behavior by me.”

Bove’s main claim to fame is that he served on the legal team that tried but failed to keep Trump from being convicted of 34 felony counts in Manhattan in 2024. When Trump later rewarded Bove a leadership position in the Justice Department, he reportedly gave an order to Justice Department attorneys in the Public Integrity Unit that a pending indictment accusing New York Mayor Eric Adams of bribery and wire fraud be dropped. U.S. District Judge Dale E. Ho found that the record “points towards an uncomfortable conclusion: that the decision to dismiss this case was apparently premised on the Mayor taking subsequent immigration-related actions in conformity with the administration’s policy preferences.”

Now, a Justice Department whistleblower says Bove sought to undermine the federal judiciary’s ability to provide effective oversight of the administration’s plans to deport certain immigrants without due process of law.

According to a letter to the ranking members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, written on behalf of former Justice Department lawyer Erez Reuveni, Bove told the team defending the administration’s immigration policies to be prepared to ignore any federal court rulings halting deportations and, according to Reuveni, consider telling judges “f--- you.”

Bove testified Wednesday that he couldn’t recall using that profanity and never advised Justice Department lawyers to defy a federal court order.

Reuveni’s minute-by-minute account of the issuance of judicial orders halting certain deportations, and the corresponding communications within the Justice Department and between federal agencies, paints a grim picture of lawyers’ knowingly defying court orders, making misrepresentations to the court and dragging their feet with the goal of ensuring the deportations could take place without judicial interference. Reuveni’s allegations, if true, paint a troubling picture of Bove’s behavior as a senior Justice Department official, one that raises serious questions about not just his qualifications for a federal judgeship, but also his fitness to practice law altogether.

Some of his critics, including Justice Department attorney Todd Blanche, another member of the Trump legal team, paint Reuveni as a disgruntled former Justice Department official who they say was fired for poor performance. Yet Reuveni received excellent reviews for over a decade during Republican and Democratic administrations. His main offense appears to be admitting that Kilmer Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man deported to a Salvadoran prison, was wrongfully deported because of an administrative error.

According to the legal profession’s code of ethics and rules governing litigation in federal court, a lawyer may not make false or misleading statements in court, may present only good faith arguments about the legitimacy of their legal positions, must not encourage others to violate the rules of ethics and must oversee lawyers they supervise in a way that ensures that those lawyers comply with their own ethical obligations. If Reuveni’s account of Bove’s conduct is true, then Bove hasn’t met the profession’s ethical obligations.

Bove isn’t the first lawyer accused of violating his ethical obligations to promote Trump’s agenda.

Bove wouldn't be the first lawyer associated with Trump accused of violating his ethical obligations to promote Trump’s agenda. For his false, misleading and even defamatory statements, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has been disbarred in two jurisdictions. John Eastman, the conservative lawyer who would come up with the patently frivolous claim that Vice President Mike Pence could overturn the results of the 2020 election, has been disbarred in California, a decision recently affirmed by that state’s highest court. Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official who urged the department to make false statements to election officials in Georgia regarding the 2020 election — and asked Trump to appoint him attorney general if Justice Department lawyers wouldn’t go along with Clark’s scheme — now faces the prospect of a two-year suspension from the practice of law.

Elihu Root, a prominent New York lawyer who held several Cabinet positions under Presidents William McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt, reportedly opined that “[a]bout half the practice of a decent lawyer consists in telling would-be clients that they are damned fools and should stop.” According to allegations regarding Bove’s conduct in his short stint in the Justice Department, specifically his attempt to push Trump’s deportation agenda no matter what, it seems he hasn’t exhibited the qualities of Root’s “decent lawyer.”

Will such reports sink his nomination? Unfortunately, given Trump’s hold on the Republican Party, that’s hard to say. Regardless, if Reuveni’s allegations hold up, Bove may well have failed to uphold his most basic obligations as an attorney."
left,"I live 3 miles from xAI’s South Memphis data center, where Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company has been operating dozens of methane gas turbines without critical — and we believe legally required — environmental permits. My neighbors and I are forced to breathe the pollution this company pumps into our air every day. We smell it. We inhale it. This isn’t just an environmental issue — it’s a public health emergency.

This isn’t just an environmental issue — it’s a public health emergency.

Memphis and Shelby County had a pollution crisis long before Musk and xAI powered up Colossus, a massive supercomputer. The American Lung Association gave us an “F” for air quality for four of the last five years, and we got a D the one year we didn’t get an F. We haven’t met federal ozone standards since 2021. We are known as an “asthma capital” in the U.S., and recent statistics found that we had the most asthma-related ER visits in Tennessee.

Now, in response to this growing threat to the air we breathe, we’re fighting back. Last week, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) sent xAI a notice of intent to sue on behalf of the NAACP, a notice that is mandatory under the Clean Air Act. This action is about justice, transparency and our human right to breathe clean air.

Together, the turbines at the xAI data center have a generating capacity that SELC says rivals that of a regional Tennessee Valley Authority power plant. Despite claims from the Shelby County Health Department, the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce and xAI that permits aren’t required for the turbines’ first year of use and xAI’s assertion that it is “operating in compliance with applicable laws,” SELC, which performed a thorough analysis of the turbine models’ specifications and applicable environmental law, disagrees. It believes xAI’s turbines are stationary engines and therefore require an air permit. SELC asked the county Health Department to shut down the turbines and explain where SELC’s legal opinion is wrong. These requests have not been met.

This is not minor. These permitting requirements exist to protect communities from exposure to hazardous emissions.

City officials celebrate xAI’s arrival as an economic win as they downplay the serious health and environmental risks and impacts.

E&E News reported in May, citing the data from environmental groups it had reviewed, “In just 11 months since the company arrived in Memphis, xAI has become one of Shelby County’s largest emitters of smog-producing nitrogen oxides.” Smog is linked to increased rates of asthma and respiratory illnesses. Rather than halt operations, xAI is now asking the Health Department to approve a permit that would allow it to permanently operate 15 gas turbines 24/7.

When 35 turbines were photographed at the site in March, far more than what had been reported, I asked Memphis Mayor Paul Young about them, and he told me only 15 turbines were active and that the rest were being stored there. SELC, however, used thermal imaging to determine that at least 33 turbines were in use. Mayor Young has dismissed xAI’s emissions as “minimal,” despite estimates that the turbines emit 1,200 to 2,000 tons of smog-forming NOx annually. City officials celebrate xAI’s arrival as an economic win as they downplay the serious health and environmental risks and impacts.

An example of this is the irresponsible pollution report the city of Memphis released Tuesday. According to the report, unspecified air monitors were placed in two areas in southwest Memphis and at City Hall downtown on two different days for less than 12 hours each day. The minuscule nature of the testing notwithstanding, the data did not include any testing results for ground-level ozone or smog."
left,"The Trump administration is planning to potentially plunge millions of American tax dollars into a new anti-immigrant pet project in Florida that sounds like it was pulled from medieval times.

You may have heard of the so-called Alligator Alcatraz being constructed in the Everglades. If not, it’s basically an old airfield that Florida Republicans are turning into a tent-filled detention facility for immigrants — and which will be surrounded by fearsome reptiles.

As The New York Times reports:

The remote facility, composed of large tents, and other planned facilities will cost the state around $450 million a year to run, but Florida can request some reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security.

Florida’s attorney general, James Uthmeier, a Trump ally who has pushed to build the detention center in the Everglades, has said the state will not need to invest much in security because the area is surrounded by dangerous wildlife, including alligators and pythons. A spokesperson for the attorney general said work on the new facility started on Monday morning.

One might say using FEMA money for such a project — after Trump has denied such aid for residents in Democratic-led states — is cruel and deranged.

As the administration also withholds congressionally authorized funding for everything from to cancer research to efforts against child sex trafficking, this moat … thing … is apparently a more worthy use of our tax dollars. The plan is part of an effort to help the administration ramp up its mass deportation agenda, which has ensnared American citizens and is largely targeting people with no criminal convictions to speak of — contradicting Trump’s campaign rhetoric that his deportations would target hardened criminals.

One might say using FEMA money for such a project — after Trump has denied such aid for residents in Democratic-led states — is cruel and deranged.

As the Times noted, Trump repeatedly floated the idea of building a border moat filled with alligators or snakes during his first term. The plan also sounds quite similar to a plan he floated for homeless people back in 2022, which he conceded would be controversial but said would involve “high-quality tents” on “large parcels of inexpensive land in the outer reaches of the cities.”

Unlike in 2019, when Trump’s administration considered using FEMA money for another archaic anti-immigrant project — a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border — the president’s wish for medieval-style immigration enforcement seems like it’s on the verge of becoming reality in this case.

It’s worth noting, though, that the administration already is facing backlash over reportedly inhumane conditions being foisted on immigrants in detention centers across the country. And it seems more than a little presumptuous to think treatment will be much better in what effectively is a jail for immigrants encircled by snakes and alligators."
left,"Meta scored a major victory in a copyright lawsuit on Wednesday when a federal judge ruled that the company did not violate the law when it trained its AI tools on 13 authors' books without permission.

“The Court has no choice but to grant summary judgment to Meta on the plaintiffs’ claim that the company violated copyright law by training its models with their books,” wrote US District Court judge Vince Chhabria. He concluded that the plaintiffs did not present sufficient evidence that Meta’s use of their books was harmful.

In 2023, a high-profile group of authors, including comedian Sarah Silverman and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates, sued Meta, alleging that the tech behemoth had infringed on their copyright by training its large language models on their work. Kadrey v. Meta was one of the first cases of its kind; now there are dozens of similar AI copyright lawsuits winding through US courts.

Chhabria had previously stressed that he planned to look carefully at whether the plaintiffs had enough evidence to show that Meta’s use of their work would hurt them financially. “The key question in virtually any case where a defendant has copied someone’s original work without permission is whether allowing people to engage in that sort of conduct would substantially diminish the market for the original,” he wrote in the judgment on Wednesday.

This is the second major ruling in the AI copyright world this week; on Monday, US District Court judge William Alsup ruled that Anthropic’s use of copyrighted materials to train its own AI tools was legal. Though Alsup’s judgement handed Anthropic a win, it was a split decision, as the AI company will still have to face the plaintiffs in court for pirating their books. The plaintiffs’ lawyers in Kadrey v. Meta argued that Meta’s use of pirated materials was a major issue, but Chhabria did not focus on the claim like Alsup did, instead noting that the parties would have a Zoom conference to discuss how to handle the piracy claims.

Chhabria further distinguished his stance from Alsup’s by stressing that Alsup was “brushing aside” the importance of market harm in his fair-use ruling by focusing on whether the use of the work was “transformative.”

In copyright law, courts determine fair use in part by looking at whether the work that’s created based on copyrighted material is “transformative,” meaning it’s not a substitute for the original but rather something new. They also assess whether the new work causes “market harm,” or hurts the original rights holder financially. “It’s notable that he disagreed, sharply but respectfully, with Judge Alsup on the market dilution theory,” says James Grimmelmann, a professor of digital and internet law at Cornell University.

Other legal experts highlighted Chhabria’s focus on market harm, too, noting that it could shape how future AI copyright cases are argued. “We haven't seen the last of this novel market dilution theory,” says Cardozo Law professor Jacob Noti-Victor. “That might change the game in the other cases, or in future litigation.”"
left,"On April 28, a nurse at the Aurora ICE Processing Center near Denver called 911. A woman in custody, four months pregnant, had arrived at the facility’s medical unit, bleeding and in pain. As the staff rushed to get vitals, the dispatcher rattled off questions: How old was she? Was the pregnancy high risk? The nurse hesitated: “She just came to us three days ago.”

On 911 audio obtained by WIRED, the dispatcher’s voice cuts in:

“Is there any sign of life?”

“Have we heard a heartbeat?”

“Does she feel any kicking?”

“We don’t have the equipment to do that,” the nurse replies.

It was just one incident in a spike of emergencies playing out inside Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers nationwide.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.

A WIRED investigation into 911 calls from 10 of the nation's largest immigration detention centers found that serious medical incidents are rising at many of the sites. The data, obtained through public records requests, show that at least 60 percent of the centers analyzed had reported serious pregnancy complications, suicide attempts, or sexual assault allegations. Since January, these 10 facilities have collectively placed nearly 400 emergency calls. Nearly 50 of those have involved potential cardiac episodes, 26 referenced seizures, and 17 reported head injuries. Seven calls described suicide attempts or self-harm, including overdoses and hangings. Six others involved allegations of sexual abuse—including at least one case logged as “staff on detainee.”

WIRED spoke with immigration attorneys, local migrant advocates, national policy experts, and individuals who have been recently detained or have family currently in ICE custody. Their accounts echoed the data: a system overwhelmed, and at times, seemingly indifferent to medical crises.

Experts believe the true number of medical emergencies is far higher.

The records WIRED reviewed capture only the medical emergencies that resulted in a 911 call—typically made by facility staff. Experts say many serious incidents likely go unreported, citing years’ worth of reports and independent medical reviews. Even among those that did prompt outside help, a third of all the calls had vague or nonexistent descriptions, with details often withheld by authorities.

For example, on March 16, a woman identifying herself as a detainee at the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, called 911. Communication was strained: The dispatcher spoke no Spanish, and the caller only a little English. ""I need help,” the woman said. ""I need … ayuda."" The line goes abruptly dead, triggering a follow-up call from the emergency operator. A staff member at the facility answers the phone: “We're at a detention center, and the detainee called 911, I'm sorry.” The woman's voice is still audible in the background, still pleading. Records indicate no ambulance was dispatched."
left,"This is an adapted excerpt from the June 24 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”

While national attention has moved away from Los Angeles, the federal government still has 700 Marines and more than 4,000 National Guard troops stationed there as part of Donald Trump and Stephen Miller’s militarized deportation program.

Of course, it is not just California. According to a new analysis from the libertarian Cato Institute, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests of migrants with no criminal history are up more than 1,000% when compared to the first year of Trump’s first term.

Every day, we are seeing stories of immigration enforcement that truly shock the conscience, as armed, masked agents rolling up to regular folks who have not been convicted or even accused of serious crimes— folks who, in many cases, are just trying to do their jobs. Often, these unidentified agents detain them as onlookers cry out for them to stop.

Every day, we are seeing stories of immigration enforcement that truly shock the conscience.

One recent example from the city of Santa Ana, California, involved a landscaper named Narciso Barranco, an undocumented man with no criminal record who has lived and worked in the U.S. for decades. He has three sons, all of whom are either active-duty or veterans of the Marine Corps.

Over the weekend, Barranco was doing what he does every Saturday: working. Video of the encounter shows Barranco being approached by armed, unidentified masked men while he was cutting the grass at an IHOP restaurant. Frightened, Barranco fled, still holding his weed-whacker. The agents then caught up with him, sprayed him in the face with something, wrestled him to the ground and started beating him.

The Department of Homeland Security alleges Barranco assaulted agents with his weed-whacker, but eyewitnesses, including the manager of that IHOP, say that’s not what they saw. “He was protecting himself,” Guilermo Villarreal told KNBC, the local NBC News affiliate. “He’s not attacking [anybody]. They were beating him so hard.”

According to Barranco’s family, he is currently being detained in an L.A. detention center. One of Barranco’s sons spoke to KNBC about what his father experienced:

“In the video, it appears his shoulder was dislocated, and he got sprayed with mace in his eyes at, like, a very close distance,” said Alejandro Barranco, a Marine veteran. “And I asked him about it, and he just broke down and said his shoulder was hurt, it hurt a lot. And then he said his eyes burn and he was thirsty, he was hungry.”

It was once generally understood that family members of active-duty service members should be protected from these kinds of deportations. But now it appears the Trump administration is just indiscriminately deporting anyone they want.

Back in April, federal immigration enforcement arrested the wife of an active-duty Coast Guardsman over an expired work visa as the couple was preparing to move into their on-base housing in Florida. In March, the wife of an Army sergeant, a woman named Shirly Guardado, who had filed paperwork for protected status, was deported by immigration officials in Texas.

According to Guardado’s family, who spoke with The War Horse, a nonprofit news organization, she “got a strange phone call at work. Some sort of public safety officer had dialed her office and wanted her to come outside to talk.”

His father's treatment has left Alejandro Barranco feeling “betrayed” by the country he served.

“In the parking lot, three men in plainclothes identified themselves as Department of Public Safety officers,” her family alleges. “Shirly approached, they said her car had been involved in an accident. But when she got close, they grabbed her and handcuffed her, telling her they were ICE agents.”

These kinds of indiscriminate deportations of people who have not been convicted of any crime are morally destructive in their own right, but it is especially appalling for this White House, which claims to stand up for troops and veterans while deporting their loved ones.

His father’s treatment has left Alejandro Barranco feeling “betrayed” by the country he served. “These are my people, and then, my dad is also my people, the community is my people, the military is my people,” he told KNBC. “At the end of the day, it’s like my people against my people, I just — I don’t know. I feel hurt.”"
left,"“All he had was name recognition, and then Mamdani had that,” my mother — a New Yorker for a half-century — said late Tuesday night when I filled her in on what had just happened in the city’s Democratic mayoral primary.

The results were an emperor-has-no-clothes moment, revealing that former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s city-in-crisis campaign was wildly out of step with what New York’s Democrats want in their next mayor. Though it’s only a local election, it’s a repudiation by the electorate of the fading Democratic dynasties, which Cuomo surely represents.

Tapping into that pessimism to lecture voters to grit their teeth and think about how much worse it could be wasn’t a winning message.

After three months of projecting his grim inevitability, beginning with a 17-minute straight to camera monologue about a city in crisis while channelling the only I can fix it vibes of another son of Queens, New York’s Democrats poured into the polls to reject Cuomo’s fear-based attempt to tap into the darker instincts of a city where most voters think things are headed in the wrong direction.

Spoiler alert: Tapping into that pessimism to lecture voters to grit their teeth and think about how much worse it could be wasn’t a winning message. Zohran Mamdani, running with much more vigor and urgency, offered a far more compelling Trump-derived counterpunch: Look at this guy. How much worse could I be?

Cuomo’s fall came as news to pundits, pollsters, editorial board members and a business class that spent millions trying to derail Mamdani, many months after he built up a small army of young volunteers knocking on doors with enthusiasm on his behalf. Suddenly, people who’ve never felt connected to the city’s suffocating backroom politics — where the politicians like to pick their voters instead of the other way around — went out to make sure their friends and neighbors voted, too.

That’s the sort of small-d democratic politics the city’s big-D Democratic gave up on many years ago — so that they could keep the same voter base that elected them in the first place, at least until those voters die or move. But that means outsiders, like the Democratic Socialists of America, willing to put in the work to get new voters to turn out, have an opportunity to change the math and wield an awful lot of power.

Mamdani’s supporters weren’t downstream of politics but active participants in it. They got an energy boost in the closing phase as former Mayor Mike , who openly envisioned the city as a luxury product while spending a quarter billion dollars on his own three runs here, put $8.3 million into outside spending backing Cuomo and trashing Mamdani.

Others dumped tens of millions more into an endless deluge of TV ads and mailers treating a smiling young man (who’s been game to talk to anyone, any time, make his case) as some sort of alien threat. It felt like an awfully heavy and negative thumb on the scale, and failed to make much of a positive case for Cuomo.

“The governor,” as his team continued to refer to him years after he resigned from that office before his own party could impeach him, turned out to be an indefinite object, giving way the moment voters had their say. The unstoppable force of Mamdani’s smiling populist promise of a city that can deliver more to New Yorkers, rather than tell them what they can’t afford to hold onto, won the day.

Mamdani’s supporters weren’t downstream of politics but active participants in it.

Cuomo, who’d dominated New York’s politics for the past two decades, clearly disdained the office for which he was running (regularly sneering about how the mayor can’t do anything Albany won’t allow), and kept his distance from the city even after moving into his daughter’s $8,000-a-month office to establish residency here. He never fully engaged with rival candidates, the press or the people in a city he hadn’t lived in for decades.

New Yorkers aren’t stupid. We know the difference between a volunteer and someone paid or pressed by their union to show up to support a politician — and we know the difference between a candidate running to manifest something new and one running because he feels entitled to public power.

National Democrats reeling after last year’s elections need to take care not to over-index what happened here. Mamdani isn’t a model, he’s a moment — a candidate with great natural gifts who also was blessed with a perfect opponent. Mamdani rose to the occasion, but he still needs to win November’s general election in what will be a crowded field, open to all voters and (unlike the ranked choice vote primary) where the most votes will win.

Cuomo could still be on the ballot. And Mayor Eric Adams, who won the Democratic primary four years ago and is running as an independent, as he’s midway through a heel turn toward Trump, also loves to punch left.

But it’s clear that Mamdani is now the favorite to be New York City’s 111th mayor, and he gave a fine primary night speech about seeking to unite the whole city and not just his political movement. But there are serious questions he’s yet to answer, including what he’d do to make government more efficient to help pay for his pricey proposals about “free” benefits to New Yorkers.

Perhaps more urgently, he’s been vague about how the police would function under him, specifically how they would or would not work with or against Trump’s federal agents, how they would handle protesters and how he would relate to the Democratic Socialists of America that’s treated its elected officials as avatars rather than independent agents.

Remarkably, endless questions about his views on Israel have helped him avoid addressing these more local and pressing concerns about how his ideology would lead him to govern.

If the center wanted to hold, it should never have lined up behind a divisive and overly familiar establishment figure like Cuomo — who’s breeded pessimism and seemed epically incapable of self-reflection about his treatment of women who worked for him, or of the political leaders who worked with him, pushed him out and then lined up behind him again this year.

It turns out that voters weren’t interested in following those leaders."
left,"The Eric Adams case was bound to come up at Emil Bove’s judicial confirmation hearing on Wednesday — and it did. But the Trump nominee stressed an odd aspect of the case, namely the fact that a federal judge granted the Justice Department’s motion to dismiss the New York City mayor’s criminal case.

It’s an odd aspect to emphasize because it was never really in doubt that U.S. District Judge Dale Ho was going to grant the DOJ’s motion, led by Bove, whom President Donald Trump made a high-ranking DOJ official after Bove represented Trump in his criminal cases. Rather, the relevant aspect is how Ho dismissed the case: With prejudice, meaning permanently. Far from being a legal victory for the administration, it was a stunning defeat that left much institutional damage in its wake, as several prosecutors resigned rather than go along with the Bove-backed scheme.

So, the fact that Ho dismissed the case with prejudice is a crucial distinction. Indeed, it’s the whole ballgame. Recall that the failed scheme hinged on the administration being able to keep the charges hanging over Adams — hence the apparent reason why Bove fought so hard not merely to dismiss the case but to do so without prejudice, so that the charges could be revived in the future if the administration were to become displeased with Adams’ political cooperation on immigration enforcement or anything else. Prosecutors who resigned said it amounted to a quid pro quo, which Bove and Adams denied.

With that context in mind, it’s clear that Bove hardly made a point at the hearing when he noted to Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., that Ho had granted the dismissal, as if to imply that the judge agreed with Bove’s reasoning.

On the contrary, Blumenthal replied with the context of Ho’s rationale for dismissing the case with prejudice, where the judge wrote of the apparent quid pro quo bid: “Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the Indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions.” The judge further wrote that the DOJ’s position was “fundamentally incompatible with the basic promise of equal justice under law.”

If he’s ultimately confirmed to be a federal appeals court judge, Bove will be tasked with meting out equal justice under law, as Ho did in the Adams case despite Bove’s best efforts. Multiple ethical red flags raise serious questions of whether he’d do so on the bench and whether he deserves to be in such a position. Republican control of the Senate means he’ll likely be confirmed either way.

But in any event, his role in the Adams affair can’t be ignored or explained away by simply observing the true, yet incomplete, fact that the judge granted the dismissal motion.

WIRED Featured Deals

Amazon Device Deals

Amazon's Eero Pro 6E (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a tri-band mesh that adds the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands. If you have a 1 Gbps or faster connection and lots of devices, this is a great mesh system for you. It performed extremely well in our tests, though the 6-Ghz band is short-range.

This deal is for the Fire Max 11 (5/10, WIRED Review) bundle, with keyboard. The Fire Max 11 is Amazon's nicest Fire tablet, but if you're thinking of doing work, keep in mind that Google's various office apps won't work. If you don't need those, this is a serviceable tablet. The screen is bright and sharp enough, the speakers aren't bad, and the cameras are 1080p.

Easily the best audiobook service, Amazon’s Audible Premium Plus gives you access to a library of Audible Originals, audiobooks, and podcasts, one credit per month to use on any audiobook title you fancy, and regular exclusive deals and discounts. Prime members can have three months for free right now (one month for non-Prime members), after which it costs $15 per month.

It may not be the best music streaming service, but Amazon Music Unlimited earned an honorable mention in our guide. Four months of free service for Prime members (three months for non-Prime members) will be enough to tempt some folks to try it.

Apple Prime Day Deals

The iPad (A16) (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has a USB-C port, a Touch ID sensor integrated into the power button, a 12-megapixel rear camera, and a 12-MP selfie camera in landscape mode (with support for Center Stage). You also get 5G on the cellular model. The A16 chip is the same one in the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15, and iPhone 15 Plus. It's plenty powerful, but there's not enough RAM to support Apple Intelligence, making it the only iPad in the lineup without access to Apple's artificial intelligence features (possibly a feature depending on your stance on AI).

Would it surprise you to know that this is the laptop I am typing on right now? Probably not. The Air is one of the most popular laptops around and for good reason. You get a powerful, portable laptop with outstanding battery life for under a grand. If your workload is graphics-intensive, you might want to go for the 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro, but for the rest of us the Air is the Apple laptop to get.

Apple's latest AirPods Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are ubiquitous for good reason. They've now got USB-C in the charging case, and this latest version sounds better than ever before. They have an IP54 sweat- and dust-resistance rating, and the noise-canceling is top-tier. Pair that with six hours of juice and a case with a speaker to help use Apple's “Find My” feature, and you have a winning combo.

The Watch Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best Apple Watch for most people. It does not have blood oxygen sensing, which is truly preposterous given that almost every other fitness tracker on the planet has it, but it can tell if you have sleep apnea, which otherwise requires a disruptive sleep test to diagnose. The Series 10 is thinner and lighter, so it's more comfortable to wear while sleeping, and it has fast charging, so it can track more of your activities during the day.

The gateway drug of Apple Watches, the entry-level SE is a compelling deal. It doesn't have the latest standout health features, but it's compatible with watchOS 11, so you'll be able to take advantage of the new Vitals app, and it has the S8 chip, which offers support for features like Crash Detection. It remains the best Apple Watch for the money.

The Beats Flex are the best headphones for Apple users under $100. They feature quick pairing, easy access to Siri, and seamless Apple Music integration, thanks to Apple's W1 chip, which ensures a rock-solid wireless connection to iOS devices. We were able to get 12-hour-plus battery life, which is good enough for a few workdays of tunes between trips to the wall charger.

The Beat Solo 4 headphones offer clear and buttery smooth sound, with good instrumental separation. As you'd expect, there's hands-free Siri and Apple Spatial Audio support, and they come with a compact carrying case for easy packing. Note that there's no noise canceling or transparency mode, no auto pause feature, or water-resistance rating.

For those overnight trips it’s nice to have a power bank capable of charging up your Apple Watch. This Anker power bank has a handy pop-up Apple Watch charger that can deliver 5 watts and supports Nightstand mode. It also has a built-in USB-C cable and a USB-C port, so you can deliver up to 30 watts to your phone or another small device.

Our top pick watch for Samsun fans, the Galaxy Watch7 features a nice rounded design—the accented 20-mm straps add a nice touch—though it is a little plain. This model infuses artificial intelligence algorithms to improve your health tracking data, like the Energy Score and updated sleep tracking capabilities.

Tech Deals

The Surface Laptop (7th Edition) is the best Surface device for most people. If you're looking for a lightweight and reliable Windows PC with good battery life, look no further. This deal is on the higher-end 13-inch model, with a Snapdragon X Elite processor, 16-GB RAM, and a 1-TB SSD. Performance was excellent in our testing, although this is not a machine for graphics-intensive tasks like video editing or gaming.

HP's Chromebook Plus x360 is a good 2-in-1 Chromebook. Its design is nondescript, but the Intel Core i3 chip is plenty speedy for Chromebook workloads, it's lightweight, and the 2-in-1 design means you can watch movies in tent mode. The speakers sound decent and get surprisingly loud, and the 1,920 X 1,200-pixel resolution is sharp on this 14-inch IPS LCD panel.

This Wi-Fi 7 mesh router offers expansive coverage and it very fast on all bands. You get a good selection of multi-gig Ethernet ports and it's easy to set up and use. The downside is the price, but this deal helps out with that. You'll need a HomeShield Pro subscription for online protection and full parental controls.

This little power bank has a 25,000-mAh capacity and can deliver up to 165 watts to two devices (it tops out at 100 watts for a single device connected via USB-C). The retractable cable is nice, and the clever braided 1-foot USB-C cable doubles as a carry loop. It has a display to show the remaining battery, charging rate in and out, battery temperature, and health.

Ugreen's 145-watt charger, with 25,000-mAh battery, is surprisingly compact for the power it provides. There are two USB-C ports and one USB-A port. What sets the Ugreen apart is that you can actually draw 145 watts while charging. That works out to one USB-C port at 100 W and the other at 45 W.

This Anker charger is very small (unfortunately, the plugs don't fold, see below if you want folding plugs), and supports 30 watt charging. That'll be enough for most phones, and can also handle tablets and even possibly low-power laptops.

This Anker plug is nice and compact, with a folding plug which makes it great for travel. If you have a phone that's capable, this is a nice way to fast charge, and this will of course be perfect for laptops, tablets, and other devices.

Outdoor Prime Day Deals

I’ve been testing smart bird feeders daily for almost a year now, and I can say definitively that no smart feeder is perfect. However, if you want something at the intersection of reliability, features, and affordability, this feeder, the top pick in our guide to the Best Smart Bird Feeders, is your best bet. This model is especially appealing as it comes with both a lifetime subscription and a solar panel to keep it charged. —Kat Merck

Hydro Flask has several types of bottles and caps available in a bunch of fun color options. You can choose one color for the bottle, another for the lid, and depending on which one you're getting, yet another for the strap or straw. In our years of testing, this has proved the most durable water bottle.

Ninja's cute and compact outdoor oven (7/10, WIRED Review) is temperature accurate, versatile, and adds a touch of smokiness without you needing to mess with the complexity (or size) of a full smoker. It's idiotproof and affordable, we love it for decks and those with limited outdoor cooking space, since you can do a lot of things with it.

Yeti reinvented the cooler, and we thank them for it. The rotomolded Tundra is built like a tank with 3-inch-thick insulated walls, and in our testing it kept ice frozen for six days in blazing 90-degree heat while stored in direct sunlight on Adrienne's deck. I (Scott) have managed to get five days out of it in the insane humidity of Florida in the spring. A Yeti hard-sided cooler is the best cooler around. Note that this deal is only on the one, wine-colored Tundra.

I like this Yeti for the wide mouth and heavy zipper that never sticks. It's free-standing, and at 14.25 inches wide, it's the perfect size for bungeeing to the top of a paddleboard or bike rack. It has both a grab handle on top and a shoulder strap, which provide plenty of points to carabiner a small dry bag or pair of flip-flops. As with the above deal, this is limited to a single color, “Key Lime.”

Of all the portable charcoal grills I've tested, the Weber Jumbo Joe remains my favorite. It strikes the best balance of affordability, features, and ease of use. It's big enough (18.5 inches in diameter) to smoke two racks of ribs or to fit burgers and corn for six people (admittedly, this was crowded) but small enough that you'll still have room in the trunk for a cooler and camping supplies.

Biolite's FirePit+ is a sleek, portable, mesh box with removable legs, a hibachi-style grill, and an ash bin. It has a rechargeable 10,400 mAh battery that can power 51 air jets for up to 26 hours. This allows you to precisely control the flame, and to some extent, the heat of the fire. The FirePit+ can burn charcoal or wood and, thanks to the fans, you don't need a charcoal chimney and you'll never struggle to get a fire burning.

Our favorite portable power station, the Explorer 2000 Plus has everything you need. It's got plenty of ports, supports fast charging, and the 2,042-watt-hour capacity will keep you running for days. You can charge it speedily from your AC outlet, but it also works with solar panels, like Jackery’s SolarSaga 200-W Solar Panel. Just be aware that it weighs a hefty 62 pounds.

When I'm not testing something else, this is the backpacking water filtration system I use and it's never let me down. It's our top pick for ultralight hikers and backpackers. It weighs just 3 ounces and has a filtration level of 0.1 microns (which gets rid E. coli, salmonella, giardia, cryptosporidium, and other common problems). The Squeeze also connects to any 28-mm diameter soda bottle (your basic 20-ounce Coke bottle, for example).

I have yet to do a trip with a satellite communicator, but I do understand why people use them. If I were to bring one along, this is the one I'd get. It's tiny, light (3.5 ounces), and easily stashable. It utilizes the super-fast Iridium satellite network, so you can send a rapid SOS from pretty much anywhere. There are extra features like waypoints and interval tracking, and it plays nice with compatible Garmin watches.

Best Home Deals

The Artisan is a design classic, but it doesn't just look great, it performs as well. It's got plenty of power, and the tilt head lifts smoothly so you can change attachments. You get four attachments in total, including a dough hook, a wire whip, a pastry beater, and a flex edge beater that manages to get right up to the sides of the bowl so no cake mixture is left behind.

The best budget Dyson vac, the Digital Slim is basic, but powerful. It lacks some of the features on newer models. For example, instead of a single power button, it still has a trigger you have to hold down while vacuuming. You'll do get a Motorbar cleaner head, a combination tool, and a crevice tool in the box. It's not compatible with fancier accessories like the Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head that shoots out a green laser to spot microscopic dust. We have seen the price dip lower on sale, but this is still a solid deal.

As seen in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers, Shark’s NeverChange doesn’t sport a filter you never have to change but it does last up to five years. WIRED reviewer Lisa Wood Shapiro found that this is only true in very small rooms, but it’s still a great deal on a decent air purifier, which now comes in fun colors like green and lavender. (Those ones aren’t on sale, though.) —Kat Merck

I love this pet camera from Petcube—it’s already super-affordable before the APD discount, and it has 360 PTZ rotation capabilities, 1080p HD resolution, 8X digital zoom, 2-way audio, and night vision. The camera feed rotates smoothly, and the wide fish-eye-like lens and panning abilities allow you to see pretty much the entire room. For a little over 50 bucks, this is the best camera you can buy at this price point. —Molly Higgins

This dual camera has 3K high definition, with 360 degree rotation up top, and a stationary camera below for even more coverage (plus it can be mounted upside down). There's also live view and two-way chat, night vision, and 6X zoom. AI detection alerts to things like barks, meows, loud noises, and fire, so you can receive notifications for anything alarming. I love that the dual cameras let me keep an eye on my pets (and everything else) while away, and at $60, this is a great deal for a super nice pet cam. —Molly Higgins

AirTags can be a bit divisive, but they’re the best way to keep tabs on your stuff if you have an iPhone. Set up with the Find My app, and you'll always know where everything is.

This is the best sleep mask overall. It’s affordable and stylish, with many different colors to choose from. It’s also soft, lightweight, and breathable thanks to its mulberry silk construction. The elastic band isn’t too tight and the mask does a solid job at blocking out most light. And I like that it comes with a drawstring case, so I don’t misplace it easily. —Louryn Strampe

GHD has something of a cult following due to its reliability and unique features like single temperature setting (365 degrees Fahrenheit) and fun little chime to let you know it’s heated up. We tout it as a more affordable alternative to the popular GHD Chronos (7/10, WIRED Review) in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, and at $73 off, it’s about as good a deal as you're going to find on a GHD. —Kat Merck

This cordless powerhouse is compact, waterproof (yes, you can use it in the shower), and charges fast in four hours. It offers three pressure settings, four tips, and a 360-degree rotating handle that gets into every nook of your mouth. The water reservoir runs for about 45 seconds per fill, just enough for a thorough clean. It also comes with a microfiber travel bag, tip case, water plug, and universal voltage. It's ideal for neat freaks or frequent travelers. —Boutayna Chokrane

There are countless Philips Sonicare electric toothbrushes to choose from, but I keep coming back to the trusty 4100. Its gentle vibrations are easier on gums than the more aggressive oscillating brushes. You get a two-minute timer, two intensity settings, and a pressure sensor to protect your enamel. Battery life is excellent, lasting about two weeks per charge, and the built-in BrushSync tech lets you know when it’s time to replace the head. It’s simple, smart, and under $50. —Boutayna Chokrane

We’ve loved the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends) for a while. It dries and styles in one go, with its 2-inch oval barrel and four heat modes (including a cool setting). The detachable head makes it easy to pack or stash in a drawer, and the ceramic titanium tech reduces heat exposure by 50 percent. It's a smarter (and safer) upgrade from the original version—which had recall issues overseas—and a cheaper alternative to Drybar tools. —Boutayna Chokrane"
left,"A European company that seeks to develop orbital spacecraft for cargo, and eventually humans, took a step forward this week with a test flight that saw its Mission Possible vehicle power up and fly successfully in orbit before making a controlled reentry into Earth's atmosphere.

However, after encountering an “issue,” the Exploration Company lost contact with its spacecraft a few minutes before touchdown in the ocean.

In an update Tuesday morning on LinkedIn, the company characterized the test flight as a partial success—and a partial failure.

“The capsule was launched successfully, powered the payloads nominally in-orbit, stabilized itself after separation with the launcher, reentered and reestablished communication after black out,” the company said in a statement. ""We are still investigating the root causes and will share more information soon. We apologize to all our clients who entrusted us with their payloads.""

Maybe It Was the Parachutes

Reestablishing communications with the spacecraft after the blackout period suggests that the vehicle got through the most thermally challenging part of reentry into Earth's atmosphere and perhaps validated the spacecraft's handling and ability to withstand maximum heating.

Following this, according to the company's timeline for Mission Possible, the capsule's parachutes were due to deploy at a velocity between Mach 0.8 and Mach 0.6. The parachutes were selected for their ""proven flight heritage,"" the company said, and were procured from US-based Airborne Systems, which provides parachutes used by SpaceX’s Dragon, Boeing's Starliner, and other spacecraft.

Given when the spacecraft was lost, it seems most likely that there was a problem with the deployment of the drogue or main parachutes.

Mission Possible was a 2.5-meter diameter demonstration vehicle that was among the larger payloads launched Monday afternoon on SpaceX's Transporter 14 mission from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The mission sought to test four primary areas of spaceflight: structural performance in orbital flight, surviving reentry, autonomous navigation, and recovery in real-world conditions. It only clearly failed in this final task, recovering the vehicle within three days to return on-board payloads to customers.

Meeting an Aggressive Timeline

It is refreshing to have such clear and concise communication from a space company, especially the acknowledgment that a flight was a partial failure, within hours of launch. And it is not a surprise that there were technical challenges on a vehicle that was put together fairly rapidly and at a low cost.

In an interview with Ars last November, the founder of The Exploration Company, Hélène Huby, said Mission Possible was developed at a cost of about $20 million in 2.5 years, in addition to $10 million for the rideshare launch on the Falcon 9 rocket.

At the time, she said Mission Possible was on track to launch this summer, and the company met this timeline.

Given the potential issues with the parachute system or other problems near touchdown, it is possible that The Exploration Company may fly another subscale demonstration mission before moving into development of its full-size Nyx cargo spacecraft."
left,"As protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s mass deportation campaign continue, the Trump administration is increasingly defending its tactics by accusing its critics of supporting serious violent criminals. But new nonpublic data — which ICE shared with people outside the agency, and which was later shared with the Cato Institute — shows that ICE has primarily detained people with no criminal convictions of any kind, let alone any serious offenses. (ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment. NBC News has not independently verified this data.)

Here’s a typical exchange from ICE’s defenders: After Kim Kardashian said she opposed “innocent, hardworking people being ripped from their families,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin shared mug shots of various immigrants in a post on X and asked her: “Which one of these convicted child molesters, murderers, drug traffickers and rapists would you like to stay in the county?”

ICE has primarily detained people with no criminal convictions of any kind, let alone any serious offenses.

But the data obtained by the Cato Institute shows that serious criminal convicts are a small minority of the people taken into custody by ICE. About two-thirds of the immigrants booked into ICE detention facilities this fiscal year had not been convicted of anything. Violent offenders like murderers, rapists and child molesters were less than 7% of ICE book-ins.

Assistant Secretary McLaughlin insists the focus is on the “worst of the worst” criminal aliens “to protect American citizens from criminal illegal aliens.” Yet most of the people ICE has brought into its custody had no victims at all. Only 11% of all ICE book-ins in fiscal year 2025 had been convicted of either violent or property crimes.

Many offenses were for victimless crimes that resulted solely from the government’s refusal to let them immigrate and live here legally. The most common convictions for “criminal aliens” detained by ICE were immigration offenses like improper entry and traffic infractions like not having driver’s licenses.

If the government granted these immigrants legal status — which, as Ms. Kardashian’s comment suggests, would be the humane approach to fix the problem — these crimes would never have happened. They are hardly the serious public safety threats Assistant Secretary McLaughlin’s response points to.

The numbers include people arrested by ICE or the Border Patrol — if the Border Patrol turned them over to ICE for detention. But the Border Patrol is arresting thousands of people in the interior of the United States and is reportedly in charge of the deportation efforts in California, and it is making interior arrests as far away as Maine.

This is not unexpected. On Day 1 of his second administration, President Donald Trump immediately rescinded DHS’ prior policy of targeting new border crossers and public safety threats for arrest, requiring it to attempt to arrest “all” undocumented immigrants, regardless of their criminal histories. The White House has also imposed arrest quotas (LINK ADDED), so ICE cannot put its full attention on finding criminal fugitives.

At the same time, the new data also indicates a recent escalation in noncriminal arrests in the last month. Since mid-May, the number of noncriminals without criminal convictions entering ICE’s custody has more than doubled — from 448 per day to 927 per day in the first two weeks of June.

The escalation against noncriminals is the result of orders from White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, according to three current and former federal immigration officials who spoke with the conservative-leaning Washington Examiner. “What do you mean you’re going after criminals?” Miller reportedly said. “Why aren’t you at Home Depot? Why aren’t you at 7‑Eleven?”

In other words, not only is ICE not focused on public safety threats. It’s actively ignoring them to go after people in Home Depot parking lots. The New York Post, citing ICE insiders, reported last week that ICE officers are saying their orders are now “quantity over quality.” They say the policy is forcing them “to leave some dangerous criminal illegal migrants on the streets.”

The Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign is not about public safety. It is not even about people who violated immigration law without being convicted of a crime. The administration is eagerly canceling the legal status of hundreds of thousands of lawful immigrants so it can deport them, too. It has even deported dozens of legal immigrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador without due process.

If Trump officials were honest, they would just say: “We don’t want these people in the country because we just don’t like them.” Instead, they mislead the public by portraying their arrests as enhancing public safety, targeting serious criminals in the country illegally. The administration is jeopardizing public safety for the niche goal of reducing the U.S. population — for no specific reason at all."
left,"This is an adapted excerpt from the June 24 episode of “The Briefing with Jen Psaki.”

Last week, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the administration’s “No. 1 concern” while carrying out its aggressive immigration raids was going after “violent criminals.” Compare that statement to this new headline from The Guardian: “Trump drives surge in ICE detentions of those with no criminal record despite stated priorities.”

“In mid-June, ICE data shows there were more than 11,700 people in immigration detention who had been arrested by ICE despite having no track record of being charged with or convicted of a crime,” the Guardian reported. “That represents a staggering 1,271% increase from data released on those in immigration detention immediately before the start of Trump’s second term.”

The administration granted Palantir a $30 million contract to develop ImmigrationOS, which would effectively allow ICE to target and surveil migrants.

The driving force behind that staggering increase is likely none other than White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, one of the architects behind Donald Trump’s family separation policy in his first term and who, in Trump 2.0, seems to be eerily obsessed with undocumented immigrants.

Last month, Miller reportedly gave Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers marching orders to start conducting mass arrests, according to The Wall Street Journal, which spoke to people familiar with the meeting. During that meeting, Miller allegedly told agents to target places like Home Depot, where migrant day laborers typically gather. Soon, ICE agents appeared to follow Miller’s advice and conducted a sweep at a Home Depot in Los Angeles.

He was also one of the people who, according to Axios, which spoke to two sources familiar with another meeting the deputy chief of staff had with ICE, demanded that the agency round up 3,000 people a day.

Miller is reportedly the architect of that and so much more of Trump’s hard-line immigration policy, and while his anti-immigration fervor may be scratching some racist ideological itch, we learned Tuesday that it may also be making him money.

A new report from the Project on Government Oversight, or POGO, a nonpartisan nonprofit government watchdog group, found that, according to Miller’s recently released financial disclosures, he just so happens to own a significant stake — up to $250,000 — in the data analytics company Palantir, a company which stands to make millions of dollars off of Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Back in April, the Trump administration granted Palantir a no-bid $30 million contract to develop a new program called Immigration Lifecycle Operating System, or ImmigrationOS, which would effectively allow ICE to target and surveil migrants in real time.

According to public records reported by The New York Times, since Trump took office, Palantir has received more than $113 million in federal spending, and it stands to receive at least $795 million more. Right now, as POGO pointed out, Palantir is already the highest performing company in the S&P 500 this year, with its stock price rising by more than 80% in 2025 so far.

Miller “could easily become involved in policy matters that have a direct and predictable impact on Palantir” and thereby his own stock portfolio.

Miller’s investments in Palantir stock, according to the watchdog, “appear to have started after the first Trump administration ended.” POGO's report goes on to note, “In the years between Trump’s first term and his second, Miller meticulously planned for an unprecedented increase in immigration enforcement. Miller’s newest disclosure was filed in mid-March and signed off by a White House ethics official in early June.”

Miller’s Palantir stock is technically in a brokerage account for one of his young children but, as POGO pointed out, “that does not legally matter, according to the Office of Government Ethics, which says “an asset that is owned by a spouse or minor child is analyzed under 18 U.S.C. § 208 [the criminal conflict of interest law] as if the employee owns it.”

Don Fox, a former acting head and general counsel of the Office of Government Ethics, told POGO that Miller “could easily become involved in policy matters that have a direct and predictable impact on Palantir” and thereby his own stock portfolio.

Palantir did not respond to POGO’s request for comment about Miller’s stock ownership, and a White House official told the watchdog that Miller “has confirmed to White House ethics officials that he has and will continue to recuse from participating in official matters that could affect those stocks.”

Now, I’m not quite sure how that works, but the bottom line here is: Miller may be profiting off of the government position he holds, while harming communities all across the country — and if that doesn’t perfectly sum up the entire Trump administration, I’m not sure what does."
left,"Last year, a former counterterrorism official who served in the Department of Homeland Security during Donald Trump’s first term published a book sounding the alarm on violent Christian extremism.

Elizabeth Neumann wrote “Kingdom of Rage: The Rise of Christian Extremism and the Path Back to Peace” as a warning about a metastasizing strain of Christian-led violence against people who don’t accept their worldview — a crisis she'd been sounding the alarm about for years. And recent news reports seem to illustrate how right she was.

In Arizona, a man accused of killing a local pastor in April reportedly confessed during a news interview in which he said he was carrying out God’s will and planned to target church leaders in other parts of the country in some sort of crusade.

This, of course, follows the recent arrest of Vincent Boelter, who authorities say targeted Democratic Minnesota lawmakers in shootings that left two dead and two injured. Multiple news outlets have reported on Boelter’s alleged Christian nationalist ties and his promotion of violent, Christian extremist rhetoric, including in sermons posted online. Authorities said his list of potential targets included other politicians, abortion-rights advocates and Planned Parenthood facilities. (Boelter has not entered a plea.)

And these killings have occurred in an environment that is awfully permissive of Christian nationalist violence. A 2022 report from the advocacy group Christians Against Christian Nationalism showed how Christian nationalist rhetoric fueled the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection. And the blanket clemency afforded to these insurrectionists this year by Trump — someone who has used messianic rhetoric to portray himself as anointed by God — could embolden other violent Christian extremists going forward.

In 2023, MSNBC columnist Sarah Posner wrote about a poll from the Public Religion Research Institute and the Brookings Institution that found a disturbing rise in belief among white evangelicals, who are essential to the MAGA base, that violence could be necessary to save the country. And if the killings in Arizona and Minnesota are any evidence, the crisis seems to have only worsened since then."
left,"Mitch McConnell may no longer be the Senate majority leader, but he does not lack for influence in the chamber’s caucus. In a private meeting Tuesday amid Republicans’ scramble to pass their budget reconciliation bill, McConnell tried to assuage the fears of senators facing blowback. “I know a lot of us are hearing from people back home about Medicaid,” he said, according to Andrew Desiderio of Punchbowl News. “But they’ll get over it.”

Will they, though? It’s true that many voters have short memories. But something tells me this one isn’t going to be forgotten — and other Republican lawmakers don’t share McConnell’s confidence.

We could see a wave of rural hospital closures in a system that already struggles to serve many of its most vulnerable people.

As more and more of those voters are learning, the “One Big Beautiful Bill” pays for its massive tax cuts for the wealthy in large part by cutting Medicaid, the health insurance program that now covers more than 71 million people. The bill also makes plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, which cover 24 million people, more expensive and more difficult to sign up for. Put it together, and under the version of the bill passed by the House, 16 million people would lose their health insurance, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. It would be the most devastating loss of health care coverage in America's history.

Senate Republicans have changed the bill — but, believe it or not, their version is even worse. The Senate legislation, as it stands, would limit how much states can tax health care providers, a technique states use to increase the federal contribution to the program and direct more funds to hospitals. That would particularly exacerbate rural hospitals’ funding crisis. Nearly 200 rural hospitals have closed or severely limited services in the last 20 years. According to a recent analysis by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, another 700 are at risk of closure — nearly a third of all rural hospitals in the country. If Republicans limit both the amount states can support these hospitals and the ability of their patients to pay, we could see a wave of new closures in a system that already struggles to serve many of its most vulnerable people.

Republicans have been successful in convincing their rural constituents to ignore the consequences of GOP policies. Since the mid-2000s, Republicans have widened their margins in rural counties, often by encouraging voters to focus on culture war demagoguery, But at least some Republicans are finding this bill hard to explain to “people back home.” And while it may not make so much of a difference that a state as deep red as Kentucky is suddenly in play, GOP incumbents in more difficult races won’t have such a cushion.

Politico reports, for instance, that House Speaker Mike Johnson “is warning in private that Senate Republicans could cost House Republicans their majority next year if they try to push through the deep Medicaid cuts in the current Senate version.” On the Senate side, North Carolina’s Thom Tillis, who faces a tough re-election race next year, went so far as to hand out a flyer to his Republican colleagues showing them that his state stands to lose tens of billions of dollars if the provider tax is capped.

To alleviate the cuts, some Republicans have suggested creating a “stabilization fund” for rural hospitals. A draft from the Senate Finance Committee, however, only earmarks $15 billion for the fund — a fraction of the shortfall these hospitals face. But even the final version is much larger, it means the government would take money away from those hospitals and then … give some of it back. That’s government efficiency, GOP-style.

McConnell’s own state of Kentucky has been a Medicaid success story.

After McConnell’s remarks became public, his office insisted that he was only talking about undeserving freeloaders who are “abusing Medicaid” by getting health insurance and not working. Republicans have used that myth to justify slashing the program and imposing onerous paperwork requirements on recipients.

In fact, McConnell’s own state of Kentucky has been an extraordinary Medicaid success story. Unlike many Republican states, Kentucky quickly accepted the expansion of Medicaid included in the Affordable Care Act. Today, it has one of the lower rates of uninsurance in the country, and only three states have more of their population covered by Medicaid.

You can tell a lot about politicians by which people they care about and work to protect. For instance, Republicans are so concerned about wealthy heirs that the House version of the budget increases the estate tax exemption to $15 million. Yet, what worries Republicans do have about Medicaid cuts seem to stem not from the health consequences of those cuts —including Americans dying earlier because they couldn’t get care — but possible political backlash.

If this bill passes — in the House version, the Senate version or something in between — the fallout will be devastating. Perhaps McConnell is right that voters will “get over it.” But perhaps enough voters will be extremely angry — and will remember who was responsible."
left,"The lavish wedding between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his partner Lauren Sanchez is scheduled for June 26-28 in Venice, Italy. For months, however, protests against the event have taken place in the city, intensifying in recent days with the “No Space for Bezos” campaign—which refers to his aerospace investments—over the social and environmental impacts of the wedding, which will occupy much of the historic lagoon center that's already under pressure from high tourist flow.

What We Know About the Event

The three-day celebration promises unprecedented pomp, situated among historic buildings, luxury yachts, and international VIPs. Three major events are already scheduled: the exclusive gala evening on June 26 at the Lido of Venice, the exchange of vows the following day in the Teatro Verde on the Island of San Giorgio Maggiore, and the grand finale on June 28 that will take place in the 16th-century Scuola Grande della Misericordia.

The guest list for the Bezos-Sanchez weddings includes Microsoft founder Bill Gates, TV host Oprah Winfrey, and actors including Leonardo DiCaprio, Barbra Streisand, Eva Longoria, Orlando Bloom, and Robert Pattinson.

Exclusive private parties are also planned at secret locations in the smaller islands of the lagoon, including Burano, Giudecca, and Sacca Sessola. It is an event that will surely leave its mark on Venice, including in terms of environmental impact and the possible inconvenience it could create for the city's transit infrastructure.

80 Jets and Over 30 Private Water Taxis

The guests will arrive on 80 private jets and travel aboard more than 30 already reserved water taxis, yachts, and gondolas.

According to some official sources, flights from New York, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Dubai are planned. Not to mention the luxury yachts coming to Venice, with moorings already planned between the Maritime Station, Punta della Dogana, San Basilio, and Riva degli Schiavoni.

Among these is Bezos' own vessel, Koru, the 417-foot-long superyacht that cost $500 million, along with its 246-foot support vessel Abeona, equipped with a helicopter deck and dedicated staff, although there is still no confirmation that it will enter the lagoon.

The only yacht already docked as of Tuesday is the M'Brace of legendary basketball player Michael Jordan, who arrived with his wife. Between 30 and 50 water taxis have been reserved full-time for all three days of the event, each of which will cost the bride and groom up to €400 an hour.

For or Against

The grand celebrations have divided public opinion. According to some, the enormous expenses for the organization of Bezos’ wedding could have a positive impact on the territory, going to finance hotels, transportation, catering, and exclusive locations. The Washington Post, owned by Bezos, has declared that about 80 percent of products and services come from local Venetian suppliers.

But at what cost? The other side of the coin includes a collective of activists and residents who started the No Space for Bezos campaign months ago, denouncing the spectacularization of the city at the expense of residents. The protesters are drawing up several plans to block roads and waterways. Among the reasons for the protest is the environmental impact that the mass mobilization of so many vehicles may have on the lagoon city, which has been battling overcrowding caused by tourists.

The City of Venice has given reassurances, however, that the marriage between Bezos and Sanchez will not cause “any disruption for the city, its residents, or tourists.” Over the years, in fact, Venice has successfully handled international events even more impactful than this one, such as the G20 Economy, the G7 Justice, bilateral state meetings, and the Art, Architecture, and Cinema Biennials. The organizers, the municipality then specifies, ""have not booked an excessive number of gondolas or water taxis, as read in the newspapers, as the interest is to ensure that the city functions normally, for everyone, without any disturbance to anyone.""

Helix

As someone who’s tested nearly every bed in Helix's fleet (there are 25 spread across the Core, Luxe, and Elite Collections, for context), I’ve got a few favorites, including the Helix Midnight Luxe, our top pick for the past few years thanks to its pressure-pain relief and lumbar support, and the Helix Dusk, which has a great medium-firm feel for back and stomach sleepers. All Helix mattresses come with free shipping, a 100-night sleep trial, and a limited lifetime warranty. For the 4th, we’ve got something special to share: Use code WIRED27 for 27 percent off the entire site. Which by the way, is the biggest discount we ever see these available for.

Birch

We aren't headed to a garden center for a birch tree for this one. The Birch mattress line by Helix takes the natural approach to constructing mattresses, with Global Organic Latex Standard latex, organic cotton, and pocketed coils. The Birch Luxe has a firmer feel that still shares the buoyant feel of latex (not to mention temperature regulating and pressure relieving as well), while the Birch Luxe Natural adds on a pillow top for increased softness. Now, for the sale: use code WIRED27 for 27 percent off site wide, and Birch will also throw in two free pillows to go along with your new bed. It's likely you won't see a deal this good for the rest of the year, because based on our records, 27 percent off is the lowest it's gone.

Nolah

Nolah took memory foam and helped evolve it into its own version, called Airfoam. This happens to be the star of the show for its beds, particularly the Nolah Evolution. By using Airfoam over the usual memory foam offerings, this hybrid was made to promote better spine alignment, pressure relief, cooling, and durability. You can pick between three firmness options, but I’ve found in testing that luxury firm to be very accommodating for all sleeping positions. The lumbar support shines, and the pillow top stands on business with pressure relief. Nolah mattresses come with free shipping, a 120-night sleep trial, and a limited lifetime warranty. Right now you can get 30 percent off sitewide, plus use code WIRED50 for another $50 off mattresses.

Big Fig

Quippy brand names are the best, and Big Fig’s is derived from “bigger figure,” as this mattress is made for heavier sleepers. A common issue with standard mattresses is that they simply may not be supportive enough for sleepers with this body type. The Big Fig Classic can support up to 1,100 pounds of weight (just make sure your frame can too!) by way of foams and pocketed coils made to be extra durable. WIRED reviewer Martin Cizmar found that while the support was evident, there was a bit of sag happening in the middle. He likened it to a hammock sort of effect, which may work for some, but not for others. It’s a firmer feeling bed, but average weight sleepers may enjoy it just as much (based on my previous tests), particularly if you prefer resting on your stomach or back, or just like firmer beds. Big Fig mattresses are sent with free shipping, a 120-night sleep trial, and 20-year warranty. Use code FIREWORKS for 20 percent off your purchase.
